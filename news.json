They are, for the most part, a good thing. But very occasionally an update can go wrong, and so some Windows users prefer to postpone updates for a week or two to make sure that there aren\u2019t any problems being delivered with the update. In addition, sometimes updates come at an inconvenient time \u2014 for example, when you\u2019re in the middle of a project with a tight deadline.\nYou can\u2019t stop updates altogether, but you can pause them. There is also a way to disable updates, but it too is not permanent. If you want to hold off in case of any potential glitches or would rather put them off as long as possible, here is how to adjust your settings. \nPause updates\n\nClick the Start button\nClick on the cog wheel in the lower left to open Settings\nOpen Update & Security\nYou should be on the Windows Update page. If you\u2019re not, click on \u201cWindows Update\u201d in the left-hand sidebar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou want to find yourself on the Windows Update page\n\n\n\nIf you have any updates pending, you\u2019ll find them listed on top. You can also check to see if you have any updates waiting. Otherwise, you\u2019ll be told you\u2019re up to date. Directly below, you\u2019ll see \u201cPause updates for 7 days.\u201d Click on that to stop your device from updating for a week. \nThe Windows Update page will now tell you that your updates have been paused. If you want, you can keep clicking \u201cPause updates for 7 more days\u201d to delay updates for additional weeks. (I was able to pause for up to five weeks.) You can click on \u201cResume updates\u201d toward the top of the screen to undo this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on \u201cResume updates\u201d when you\u2019re ready\n\n\nIf you\u2019d like to pause updates up to a specific date, click on \u201cAdvanced options\u201d toward the bottom of the page. Scroll down to \u201cPause updates.\u201d Here, you can select a date to pause updates until. Note: you can only pause updates for up to 35 days, after which you\u2019ll have to update your device before you can pause the updates again. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down the \u201cPause updates\u201d for a longer pause\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSelect date\u201d lets you choose a date to resume\n\n\nAdjust restart times\nWindows will usually need to restart to finish installing updates \u2014 and since an update can take your computer out of service for anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, you may want to adjust the restart times for when it\u2019s most convenient. \n\nIf an update\u2019s available, you\u2019ll see it at the top of the screen. If you don\u2019t see that an update is available, click \u201cCheck for updates\u201d at the top of the Windows Update menu to make sure.\nIf updates are ready, you can click \u201cRestart now\u201d to restart immediately (and get it over with). Assuming you don\u2019t want to do that, click on \u201cSchedule the restart\u201d to finish the install later. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll see a \u201cRestart now\u201d button toward the top of the screen, next to \u201cSchedule the restart.\u201d\n\n\n\nToggle \u201cSchedule a time\u201d from off to on.\nSelect a time and date. Don\u2019t forget to click the check mark at the bottom of the drop-down options for time to save the selected time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll have to toggle on the switch at the top before choosing a time and date.\n\n\nIf you go back to the Windows Update page and click on Advanced options, you can toggle on several update options, including \u201cShow a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating\u201d and \u201cRestart this device as soon as possible when a restart is required to install an update.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, you can choose to switch on notifications for updates and to restart when an update is available.\n\n\nWindows can, if you choose, track when you use your device to schedule update restarts at a convenient time. You can use this feature, called active hours, to adjust what times your device can restart.\n\nIn Windows Update, go to \u201cChange active hours.\u201d\nYou can toggle on \u201cAutomatically adjust active hours for this device based on activity.\u201d \nYou can set your own active hours by clicking on the \u201cChange\u201d link next to the current active hours.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can have Windows set the active hours based on your activity, or you can set them yourself.\n\n\nAdjust the times in the pop-up window and click \u201cSave.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSet your own active hours by adjusting the time in this window.\n\n\nDisable updates\nIf you want to stop updates from happening for longer than that, there is a way to disable updates. However, even this is not permanent; most sites report that eventually (especially with a reboot), updates do resume. This may give you some breathing space, however.\nUse Win+R to open the \u201cRun\u201d box, and type in \u201cservices.msc.\u201d Hit \u201cOK.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType \u201cservices.msc in the \u201cRun\u201d box\n\n\nScroll down to Windows Update and double-click on it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScroll down to \u201cWindows Update\u201d\n\n\nIn the \u201cStartup type\u201d drop-down menu, select \u201cDisabled.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting \u201cWindows Update\u201d to \u201cDisabled\u201d will stop updates \u2014 for a while\n\n\nClick \u201cOkay\u201d and restart your PC. \nIf you change your mind, you can follow these steps to re-enable it. You may note that you can choose \u201cManual\u201d or \u201cAutomatic.\u201d (Most Windows 10 PCs come set to Manual, which simply means that the update is triggered by an event and doesn\u2019t happen automatically when you reboot.)\nUpdate March 12th, 2021, 10:20AM ET: This article was originally published on May 22nd, 2020 and has been updated to add a section on disabling Windows Update.","Author":"Aliya Chaudhry"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  8:00am EST","Title":"The best wireless earbuds to buy right now","Article":"The true wireless earbuds market has never been more crowded than it is in 2021.

Bose QuietComfort Earbuds\n\nBest noise-canceling earbuds\nThe QuietComfort Earbuds offer very powerful active noise cancellation, but what\u2019s equally nice about them is how customizable the ANC is. You can choose between 11 different levels of noise cancellation (based on how much of the outside world you want mixed in) and set three favorites to cycle between when you double-tap the left earbud. \nBose\u2019s premium earbuds put out fantastic audio with punchy bass. Their transparency \/ ambient mode is second only to Apple in how natural it sounds.

Apple AirPods Pro\n\nBest wireless earbuds for the iPhone\nThere\u2019s no beating the interplay between AirPods and Apple\u2019s other devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The AirPods Pro don\u2019t offer the best sound quality of our top picks, but it\u2019s perfectly satisfactory to many people. And the active noise cancellation is right up there with Bose. \nBut it really all comes together if you\u2019re in Apple\u2019s ecosystem and also own a Mac or iPad. The AirPods Pro can automatically hop between devices based on which one you\u2019re using, and on iPhone or iPad, spatial audio delivers immersive surround sound when watching streaming video apps. They\u2019re fantastic for making calls with, and Apple continues to pull ahead of competitors when it comes to ease of use. \nHere\u2019s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from Comply or Dekoni.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple AirPods Pro\n\n\n\n\n                $190\n              \n\n                $249\n              \n\n                  24% off\n                \n\n\n              Prices taken at time of publishing.\n            \n\n\nApple\u2019s flagship earbuds improve on the regular AirPods with better sound quality, excellent active noise cancellation, and immersive spatial audio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n              $190\n              \n\n              at Woot\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              $199\n              \n\n              at Amazon\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n              $200\n              \n\n              at Best Buy\n            \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.\nPhoto by Chris Welch \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n3.

Ultimate Ears has a fit \u201cguarantee\u201d and will send you a second set of tips should your first molding attempt go awry.

Tired of streaming Grand Theft Auto roleplay, and of streaming herself playing games more generally \u2014 something she\u2019d been doing nearly every day for around six years. \u201cI didn\u2019t just want to sit and play games all day, I realized,\u201d she says when I reach her by Discord. \u201cI want to either tell a story through roleplay or just do something that made it feel fulfilling, and roleplay wasn\u2019t that.\u201d So she decided to make a change: instead of streaming herself playing games, she\u2019d stream herself making things for her business.\nThat business was leatherworking. Proxy made the jump from full-time game streamer to full-time crafting streamer at the beginning of this year; it was a nerve-wracking but ultimately necessary step. \u201cIt\u2019s been unbelievably different in the best way possible,\u201d she says. \u201cMy viewers have gone up, my subs have gone up. And I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that my community members are seeing me be happy, right? They\u2019re seeing me do something that I love.\u201d The people who stayed, she says, want to buy her work and learn how she makes it.\n\nTwitch is usually thought of as a place for streaming video games. And while that reputation is deserved \u2014 yes, a lot of people stream their gaming on Twitch \u2014 the site also has a surprising breadth of channels. Makers & Crafting is one of them; the category was created in 2018, after Twitch renamed \u201cHobbies & Crafts\u201d to better represent the many pros who streamed in it (in their words). According to Twitch Tracker, a website that logs Twitch statistics, the category averaged 520 viewers in September 2018, the month it was created. As of January 2021, Makers & Crafting was averaging 1,520 viewers, or about three times more. \nMakers & Crafting streamers are calmer. Less frenetic. The vibe is aggressively wholesome\nThe people who stream in the category do everything from embroidery to woodworking; it\u2019s mesmerizing to bounce among them. Makers & Crafting is a warm, welcoming category that feels a little intimate. The streams can run long \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re making physical goods \u2014 but every streamer I\u2019ve seen seems to vibrate at a slightly different frequency than the people who stream on the rest of the site. They\u2019re calmer. Less frenetic. The vibe is aggressively wholesome. In other words: it\u2019s about as close to an oasis as you can get online.\n\nStreaming anything is difficult. In every broadcast you have to be a host, producer, audio engineer, and video technician \u2014 all at the same time. Streaming your crafts, however, is harder: making things for an audience is a special kind of difficult, especially if the products you\u2019re making are eventually going to be sold. What\u2019s perhaps more interesting is how learning crafts has changed with the accessibility of the internet. Proxy and another streamer and woodworker I spoke to, WorkedLettuce3 \u2014 whose handle was chosen by the Xbox gamertag gods \u2014 both learned their crafts from the internet. \n\u201cI watched a lot of YouTube videos,\u201d he says. \u201cI just never thought it would be something I would take up. Because, you know, a lot of woodworking YouTubers in particular, they like to flex their shop, they like to flex all the hundreds of thousands of dollars they spent on their tools, right? And, yeah, I mean, that was never gonna be me.\u201d Even so, he found a channel that he says motivated him to be a woodworker \u2014 one that emphasized that you didn\u2019t need tons of gear to pick it up as a hobby. \u201cI\u2019m very, very glad I found it because I\u2019ve been loving just messing around woodworking, hanging out with people in the garage like we\u2019ve been doing now,\u201d he says.\n\nProxy also learned some of the tools of her leatherworking trade from the internet. Her foray into the Makers & Crafting section coincided with the first time she tried her hand at leatherworking. \u201cI started leather crafting January of this year. Like my first time really getting my hands on my own stuff was in January,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I spent the last year researching. So starting in 2019 and all through 2020, I did nothing but watch YouTube videos and Instagram videos. I did tons of research.\u201d Proxy says she\u2019s always been gifted in working with her hands. Leatherworking is just the most recent outlet. (She also went to art school.)\nLettuce is in a similar position; before six months ago, he\u2019d never sawn a board in half. \nHe\u2019d never streamed before, either. His first streaming setup was just streaming directly to Twitch from his phone; these days, he\u2019s got a dedicated PC in his garage, a couple webcams, and the TV from his living room to read chat on. And his chat is important: among his viewers are veteran woodworkers and other crafters, along with people who\u2019ve just stopped by to watch. The woodworkers help him when he\u2019s stuck; he says there are people there who have coached him through his entire woodworking career. That kind of interaction is unique to Twitch, and to the Makers & Crafting section in particular. \nLettuce is in a similar position; before six months ago, he\u2019d never sawn a board in half\nEven so, he says he finds woodworking on stream scary sometimes. \u201cLike, before the first time I turned my table saw on, I was terrified. Before I turned my router on for the first time, I was terrified. Before I ran a circular saw for the first time, I was terrified,\u201d he says. And he did fall into some bad habits \u2014 like reading chat from his phone while working on things. \u201cMy chat would see me reading the chat from my phone. And a couple people in there just like stepped in and they were like, \u2018Yo, like, for real. You can\u2019t be doing that.\u2019\u201d He credits chat with keeping him honest.\n\u201cNo one is coming in to backseat you,\u201d says Proxy. \u201cThey\u2019re not like, \u2018Oh, you should go here and you should do this. And oh, you didn\u2019t kill my favorite boss.\u2019\u201d Viewers are there to watch someone make something, and maybe learn a little in the process. \nProxy also makes just about everything in her store live on stream\nProxy also makes just about everything in her store live on stream. Which she says is intimidating but also rewarding \u2014 because viewers (who are also buyers) can see exactly how much labor goes into making what they\u2019ve bought. \u201cThey get to see what work is actually being put into this,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, you know, a quick two hours, and it\u2019s done. It\u2019s a grueling two hours. Like everything is hand cut, and hand stitched and glued and stamped.\u201d \nNot everyone sells what they make on stream. Another crafter I spoke to, LaserGeekCreations, says that he doesn\u2019t usually create the things that show up in his shop on stream. \u201cMainly because a lot of the stuff that\u2019s on my Etsy shop is like, quick and easy to make,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of boring to make a lot of the time.\u201d (He assuages this boredom by creating things like a giant wooden dinosaur, which he also destroyed on stream.) LaserGeekCreations also happens to be the streamer who raided Lettuce when he was just starting out \u2014 which gave Lettuce his first real start on Twitch. \n\n\nIt\u2019s not all fun and games on Twitch. The larger viewer community can sometimes be brutally toxic to people who don\u2019t fit its notions of who can and can\u2019t be a streamer; recently, Twitch partner Negaoryx lamented, at Twitch\u2019s 2020 Participation Ceremony event, that the chat was targeting presenters with tons of hate speech. \n\n\nThere's more than 42,000+ viewers watching the Twitch Participation Ceremony on the offical @Twitch channel now. Users in chat are spewing hate speech & harassing the guest streamers. 3 mod names in the chat list but since I've been watching, have seen ZERO messages get deleted.\u2014 negaoryx (@negaoryx) January 23, 2021\n\n\n\nMakers & Crafting feels different, though. It\u2019s smaller, for one thing. But all the people I\u2019ve spoken to who\u2019ve been involved with the category think it\u2019s a uniquely welcoming space nestled within the larger Twitch community. \u201cIt was almost like \u2014 it\u2019s gonna sound fucking hilarious \u2014 but it was almost like walking into a warm hug,\u201d says Proxy. \u201cIt was just like everyone was so welcome.\u201d During her first week in the section, Proxy says she went from getting around 100 viewers to getting more than 500. They were leatherworkers and other crafters; they dropped tips and ideas and support.\nLettuce had a similarly warm experience. \u201cThe Makers & Crafting community is \u2014 I\u2019m gonna say in my opinion, but I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a fact \u2014 that they\u2019re the most welcoming and loving community-minded community I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life.\u201d Once the pandemic is over, Lettuce says, he\u2019s considering driving from Las Vegas, where he lives, to New Jersey, where his parents are, and visiting his friends from Twitch on the way. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever leave Twitch. I mean, live-streaming and the community in general,\u201d he says. \u201cThe stream will still be a thing, but I think interpersonal communication and hanging out and, you know, giving someone a firm handshake is my end goal.\u201d\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever leave Twitch.\u201d\nLaserGeekCreations has been streaming crafting for longer than Lettuce and Proxy, and he confirms their assessments of the community. \u201cThe makers community is such an amazing community. I think you\u2019ve probably heard that from other people already,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause it doesn\u2019t matter what you\u2019re making. We\u2019re all makers, we all like seeing what other people are doing. Everyone\u2019s so supportive of each other.\u201d\nThat kind of supportive community feeling can be invaluable if you\u2019re trying to finish something. As anyone who\u2019s tried to make anything knows, creating things is hard because going from idea to reality requires a number of steps, which sometimes aren\u2019t particularly obvious. On Twitch, the Makers & Crafting community makes it just a little easier.","Author":"Bijan Stephen"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  9:00am EST","Title":"When games are hard on their hands, some players turn their voices into controllers","Article":"As both a software engineer and an avid player of strategy games, chaosparrot struggled to reckon with the damage his work and hobbies had done to his hands. By 2017, the consistent pain of his repetitive stress injuries was bad enough that he could no longer type comfortably or enjoy the games he loved to play. While searching for solutions, he came across a video of someone using speech recognition software to code. He decided to try using the same tech \u2014 not for coding, but for playing games.\n\u201cI started the process of trying to play the old games that I couldn\u2019t play anymore with sounds instead,\u201d chaosparrot says. The project started in Python, which he used to create a full voice control program that enables him to play games hands-free. And it worked: he was able to reach just one tier below the rank in Starcraft he had attained before his injuries, and he also beat Hollow Knight, a twitchy game that\u2019s likely to frustrate players even with a traditional controller, using just his voice.\n\nGames have slowly gotten more accessible over time, but when features are missing or controls don\u2019t work, the onus falls on disabled players to find their own ways to play. Many disabled players use a combination of adaptive hardware \u2014 such as mouth-operated controllers and specially designed joysticks \u2014 and various apps to enable features like eye tracking, screen resizing, or voice control. Chaosparrot\u2019s use of voice is just one of the many customizable, bespoke solutions players have turned to.\n\u201cWe have to make it ourselves\u201d\n\u201cThat\u2019s like life when you have a disability. Anything that I kind of want, or need, and it\u2019s not available, we have to make it ourselves,\u201d says Kyle Abbate, who runs onehandmostly, a YouTube channel focused on accessibility in games. That might be a cup holder for his wheelchair, attachments for his keyboard and mouse, or the software setups he uses to play games. \u201cA lot of stuff for disabled people is trial by error, and making your own accessible tech, and whatever works for you, and experimenting and trying to find what\u2019s best.\u201d\nChaosparrot\u2019s program, Parrot.Py, was inspired by Talon Voice, a freely available voice recognition software for writing, coding, and theoretically any other computing task. By teaching Parrot.Py specific clicks, hisses, and clucks and associating them with button inputs in a game, chaosparrot is able to vocalize commands \u2014 selecting units in Starcraft or attacking and dashing in Hollow Knight \u2014 in addition to using eye tracking for movement. He hopes to get it working in a variety of game genres, and has even tested it while playing Among Us, though that involved explaining to friends why he was hissing into his mic on the way to electric. \n\nThere are other players who use older, preexisting voice control programs like VoiceAttack and GAVPI as viable alternatives to typical controllers. But regardless of the program, there are still hurdles that come with voice as a control method. Voice controls create a time delay between giving a command and the move being executed in the game, which makes for a more difficult gameplay experience, especially in games that call for fast reaction times. \nThere\u2019s also more mental labor involved in setting up voice commands before diving into a game. Both VoiceAttack and GAVPI require more tech literacy than just running a game by itself, and Parrot.Py requires at least a basic familiarity with coding. Using any of these programs involves extra steps on top of the existing barriers that come with playing as a disabled person. \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be hard to bridge that gap,\u201d says chaosparrot. Like Abbate has done for VoiceAttack, he plans to make videos explaining how to use his program.\nBeyond the quirks of setting up voice controls, some games are just more difficult to play than others. A game like Celeste, which requires fast decision-making and movement, presents a challenge, but is more playable thanks to a built-in assist mode that allows for adjustments in speed, stamina, and invincibility. For games without an assist mode, adjusting elements like health or attack damage with a program like Cheat Engine can make the game adapt to the player, meeting them in the middle between what they\u2019re capable of and what the game requires. \u201cI think if you look at the future of accessibility, I think [an assist mode] is a great thing to add, at least to single-player games,\u201d says chaosparrot. \n\nInclusive design requires time, careful consideration, and a willingness to solicit feedback from people with a variety of disabilities. Developers don\u2019t always have adaptive play styles in mind, and don\u2019t necessarily have the best track record for considering how disabled people might interact with their games, from button-mashing triggering chronic pain flare-ups to flashing lights potentially causing seizures. \nImprovements in gaming accessibility have often been the result of disabled people advocating for themselves. Microsoft\u2019s Xbox Adaptive Controller was developed with guidance from advocacy groups like AbleGamers to better address the needs of disabled players. A letter from a disabled player is what pushed Naughty Dog\u2019s team to consider accessibility in their games. They prioritized accessibility in The Last of Us Part II as a result, and the game was praised for its wide range of customizable options like remappable controls and audio cues for players with low vision.\n\u201cThe disabled community on social media has been growing\u201d\nThose pushes for more accessible features are also found on social media platforms, where disabled people band together to bring awareness to what\u2019s missing in games and what fixes have been made. \u201cThe disabled community on social media has been growing and becoming more and more vocal,\u201d says Courtney Craven, founder of Can I Play That, an accessible game review site.\nPlayers continue to advocate for accessibility in games by reaching out to developers and showcasing and sharing the kinds of solutions they use. Chaosparrot\u2019s Parrot.Py is designed to address his needs, but he and other players know that accessibility will never be one-size-fits-all. \n\u201cI encourage devs to take a look at their game and their mechanics, and then think about \u2018how do we make these accessible,\u2019\u2019\u2019 says Abbate. \u201cAnd then when you\u2019re making your next game, \u2018how can we iterate again, and make those changes, make it even better.\u2019\u201d","Author":"Kait Sanchez"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 11:00am EST","Title":"Grassroots online efforts are forming a new queer network of care","Article":"Almost exactly one year ago, Theo Hendrie thought he might have to drop out of school. His partner had lost his job, and they were struggling to pay bills and make ends meet. He worried that X Marks The Spot, his newly released anthology, might be the only creative project that he\u2019d ever be able to complete. And then, at just the right time, Tuck Woodstock\u2019s Gender Reveal mutual aid program came through. \n\u201cUp until then it was always, you know, when we\u2019ve got a tenner we\u2019ll put it into so-and-so\u2019s top surgery fund, and they\u2019ll probably put something into mine later on, and it all gets swapped around,\u201d Hendrie says. \u201cWhereas I think Tuck\u2019s thing was the first time I saw something that was helping the community as a whole, and helping us to do something creative rather than just paying for medical bills.\u201d\n\u201cIt became just, \u2018Do you need money to live? Do you need money in order to pay rent, to feed yourself, to pay for your medications?\u2019\u201d\nHendrie received \u00a375, and credits the money with allowing him to stay in school. Admittedly, that doesn\u2019t sound like a lot. But since then, he has graduated from university and returned, for a master\u2019s degree in media and communications. Like the thousands of other folks who have benefited in some form or fashion from mutual aid, monetary assistance empowered him to pursue his goals and stabilize his life, sans disruption.\nHendrie\u2019s experience is not unique \u2014 all across the internet, people are accessing assistance and care through digital networks that, inevitably, spill into the offline, everyday lives of queer folks. When people in the LGBTQ community feel excluded from, unwelcome in, or underserved by mainstream health networks, groups like QueerCare, For The Gworls (FTG), and transanta step in, offering aid in the form of care and, often, cash. \nWoodstock launched their mutual aid fund via Gender Reveal at the beginning of the pandemic, when it became obvious that people urgently needed help. The fund replaced what was originally the Gender Reveal Grant, which required folks to present their work to a panel of judges. It wasn\u2019t appropriate for the moment, Woodstock says. \u201cIt became just, \u2018Do you need money to live? Do you need money in order to pay rent, to feed yourself, to pay for your medications?\u2019\u201d \n\u201cWe are just following in those footsteps\u201d\nWoodstock\u2019s pivot to mutual aid and away from the Gender Reveal Grant is emblematic of a larger shift that happened in 2020, courtesy of COVID-19. It\u2019s been well documented that the pandemic exacerbated inequality across the board; in some marginalized communities, doubling down on care independent of mainstream systems was the recipe for survival. \nBut this building of DIY care networks has been decades in the making. Queer people and other marginalized groups have been doing this grassroots work for generations, and the modern ubiquity of GoFundMe pages and Instagram accounts is merely the latest chapter in a long history of alternative care. \nAsanni Armon, founder of FTG, credits Langston Hughes and the rent parties of the Harlem Renaissance with the idea to raise money for Black trans people\u2019s rent and gender-affirming surgery costs. \u201cWe are just following in those footsteps,\u201d Armon says. \u201cAs long as we\u2019ve been affected by the ills of capitalism, especially Black people, we\u2019ve had to do this kind of work.\u201d \nMutual aid can look like a lot of different things, depending on what you need \u2014 while Woodstock has sent money in amounts as big as $800 (and as small as Hendrie\u2019s \u00a375) via PayPal and Venmo, FTG just helped raise $50,000 for 23 young people to receive a year\u2019s worth of hormone replacement therapy, through Point of Pride\u2019s new HRT Access Fund. Historically, mutual aid has been a way for folks on the fringes of mainstream economies to collectively access resources and provide care; look at the Black Panther Party\u2019s breakfast program, or the AIDS activism of ACT UP, and you\u2019ll see the same network formation, sans internet. \nThe pandemic put a stop to FTG\u2019s rent parties, but it hasn\u2019t slowed the proliferation of mutual aid programs within the queer community\nIt\u2019s no coincidence that these networks typically form alongside activism work, says Kirsty Clark, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Yale School of Public Health whose research focuses on LGBTQ mental health. \n\u201cWhen folks are pushed to the margins, they create social networks through formal or informal channels where people can give each other information and support,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s this coming together to push back against persecution and to forge a feeling of belongingness within the group. And these networks not only produce peer support, but then can also lead to resources for medical care.\u201d \nWhile the pandemic has put a stop to FTG\u2019s rent parties, and forced organizations like Trans Defense Fund LA (TDFLA) to host their self-defense courses online, it has not slowed the proliferation of mutual aid programs within the queer community \u2014 quite the opposite. TDFLA just shipped out another 200 self-defense kits for trans folks in LA; FTG announced on February 8th that, since its inception in July 2019, $1.1 million has been redistributed to Black trans folks around the world; Woodstock, of Gender Reveal, raised $100,000 in one month alone. Clearly, the practical implications of mutual aid are real, and, often, life-saving. \n\u201cThe biggest success is that we are supplying people with the necessary tools they need and it\u2019s going in their hands,\u201d says Nikki Nguyen, the organizer behind TDFLA. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest part \u2014 just being able to provide this for the trans community.\u201d","Author":"Emma Banks"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 10:00am EST","Title":"The art of upcycling old sneakers into high-fashion corsets","Article":"Modern fashion is fraught with wasted product, so some designers are thinking about ways to transform these unwanted goods into artistic pieces meant for the runway. One of those is FRISKMEGOOD\u2122, a futuristic brand that creates upcycled high fashion and editorial pieces out of used or deadstock sneakers and other secondhand finds. Owner and designer Cierra Boyd found success on her Depop shop when her signature designs \u2014 corsets and bodysuits made from old or unused shoes \u2014 were featured on its Explore page. Now, her brand\u2019s ballooning popularity has enabled Boyd to pursue opportunities beyond her online shop.     \nBoyd, based in Cleveland, Ohio, now lives and works in her studio apartment after three years of growing her business and creativity from her mom\u2019s house. While she hopes to eventually expand, everything one can find on her shop and website has been handmade by her. Her corsets and bodysuits have gained her followers on social media, been presented in fashion shows, and most notably, worn by American rapper Dream Doll. \nThe corsets and bodysuits aren\u2019t all that Boyd upcycles, though. I reached out to her to chat about sustainable fashion, how she creates her sneaker designs, and what she has planned for FRISKMEGOOD\u2122.\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\nWhat was the inspiration behind the bodysuits and corsets made out of repurposed sneakers?\nIt kind of came about all by chance. I was in a design competition in 2018, in Cleveland. It was Fashion Mania 2k19, and I was given three challenges. One goal was to create something without using fabric. I was stumped. I did not know what to do. I had everything done with the other two challenges, but it was getting down to the wire.\nLuckily, one night I was watching Vice while I was designing and an episode came on about a guy who made a mask out of sneakers. I was like, wait, what if I made a top out of sneakers? So, I tried to make a top and it didn\u2019t look right. I moved it down a little and I was like, \u201cOh, well this is kind of cute as a corset.\u201d\nI just rolled with that and I put it on Depop. People bought it! I was super surprised but it also gave me confidence. At the time I really didn\u2019t know how to feel about it, but I just put it out there anyway to see how people will respond. The response was overwhelming. So I never stopped making them. \n\n      \n\n\n \n  View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \nA post shared by FRISKMEGOOD\u2122\ufe0f (@friskmegood.inc)\n\n\n\nAfter realizing people liked the sneaker corsets, how did you begin to source your material?\nAt the beginning, I was using stuff in my attic and stuff that I had around the house. When I started to deplete that inventory, I did go to thrift shops. Recently, for the bodysuits, I found a place here in Cleveland that has deadstock sneakers. They have sneakers that have been in their stores since the early 2000s.\nA lot of their inventory is extremely old, the sneakers are falling apart. I\u2019m not gonna lie, one time I found mouse droppings in shoes. It\u2019s really crazy and rough in there. It\u2019s a lot, but they give me the sneakers that are damaged or the average customer wouldn\u2019t buy. I use that to upcycle them into the bodysuits. \nHow did you even find this place? \nIt\u2019s funny because it\u2019s right down the street from my house, and never in my life have I gone in that warehouse. I used to go to elementary school around that area. I would pass that place my entire life and never went there. Then one day I was like, let me just see what they got in there. It was like a gold mine. \nWhen you are choosing your shoes or the deadstock, do you choose the shoes with the design in mind? \nI work a lot different from other designers. Some designers draw their designs beforehand, but for me, I usually let the materials give me the story instead of vice versa. I let the clothes tell me the story. I have to see it to know what I\u2019m going to do with it. It\u2019s really like a visual thing. When I see it I\u2019d be like, oh, that\u2019d be a cute bodysuit, and then just get five pairs of them if I can find them.\nHave you ever run into the issue of not having enough to make something?\nOh yeah, definitely. The warehouse is so unpredictable. I have to bring my mom with me most of the time to help me because it\u2019s a lot to sort through. I\u2019m literally on the floor going through all the shoes on the bottom, searching for a match. It can be stressful, but if there is a match, I always get it. Like I said, I need like five or more [shoes] to do what I really want to do. \n\n      \n\n\n \n  View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \nA post shared by FRISKMEGOOD\u2122\ufe0f (@friskmegood.inc)\n\n\n\nDo you have a certain size in mind when you\u2019re looking for them?\nEverything is so random. I usually just go with whatever I find, but if I am looking for something that\u2019s more like a plus-size look, I\u2019ll go for size 10 and up. Usually for smalls and mediums, you can even use kids\u2019 shoes. [Size] five is usually the lowest I\u2019ll go \u2014 five or four.\nWhen you are thinking about size, are you making pieces so your size range is inclusive or are you making them for a specific client?\nWhat I do ... nothing is planned. If I do find that 10 or 12, you know, that\u2019s perfect, but if I don\u2019t, then I don\u2019t. It\u2019s kind of like an \u201cit is what it is\u201d situation. \nWhat other types of clothing or fabrics do you upcycle?\nI\u2019ll use anything from bedsheets to other materials, like maybe hoodies and sweatshirts. Another thing that I just started doing is called tufting. Which is kind of like the art of making rugs, but instead of making rugs I put tufted art on the front of it. It\u2019s a fairly new thing and I haven\u2019t even dropped it yet, but basically it\u2019s made out of yarn. And what I\u2019m trying to do with that is give a new vibe and a new feel to an old, blank, unloved sweatshirt, T-shirt, or thrifted item. \nEven jeans.

I usually do things in bulk, too. So, for a bodysuit, I\u2019ll buy like five different styles. I\u2019ll work on five at once. That whole process can take two to three days. For the tufting, depending on how many I\u2019m doing, what it is, it can take like one to four days to do. It takes up a lot of time.\nDo you have a personal favorite from your collection?\nIt\u2019s so hard. I have so many.\nOne of my favorites that I\u2019ve done, that I\u2019m proud of, is my Air Force One bodysuit. That\u2019s for plus-size women or anybody who identifies as a woman. My uncle donated those shoes to me. I didn\u2019t have to go out and even buy those. It was just pretty much perfect, so that\u2019s definitely my favorite, for sure. \n\n      \n\n\n \n  View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \nA post shared by FRISKMEGOOD\u2122\ufe0f (@friskmegood.inc)\n\n\n\nYou sell your clothes on Depop now. Is that where you started? \nYes, that is where I started. Depop is how people found out about me. Before Depop I was on Instagram trying to figure out, how do I get more people to see it? When Depop came along, I ended up getting pictures on the Explore page and the Explore page puts you literally right smack dab in the front. So when people started to find me from that it was a chain reaction, and more people started finding me.\nDo you see Depop as the hub for futuristic fashion like yours? \nYes, it definitely reminds me of if you could just go to a worldwide thrift store online.\nI joined their Now \/ Next program, which is an incubator-program-slash-grant that they gave me. I get mentorship and money towards working on my Depop shop. They\u2019ve given me so many chances to be on the forefront of their platform. I\u2019ll be on their Instagram page. It\u2019s just crazy how much support they have given me. They\u2019ve invited me to Depop Live, which is an event that, pre-COVID, you can sell your stuff in person. My stuff sold out. They have been a complete blessing in disguise for me.\nDo you have any future plans for FRISKMEGOOD\u2122?\nI have a lot of future plans. Everything is in the works right now. We are a global brand right now. We definitely do get a lot of international customers. I hope on growing, expanding, and figuring out how I can take FRISKMEGOOD\u2122 to the next level. You know, how to get my stuff on more celebrities. I have a showroom now that houses my pieces, so that way I can get more celebrity visibility with my brand.\nEverything is falling in line, slowly but surely. I hope this year I can find more innovative ways to create fashion, to continue to change the way that people view sustainable fashion. I just want to change the way people think when it comes to sustainability. When you think sustainability, you don\u2019t automatically think luxury at all. I\u2019m really trying to show people that sustainable and old pieces that might never have been loved again, can be loved again. It can be high fashion and it can be luxury.","Author":"Kaitlin Hatton"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 10:30am EST","Title":"How modders rebuilt Resident Evil 4\u2019s graphics from scratch","Article":"Albert Marin has taken some very specific vacations. In Wales, he visited Raglan Castle to snap pictures of its stone wall. At the Palau G\u00fcell in Barcelona, he took meticulous photos, not of the building itself, but of the marble floor and its unique veins.\nHis trips followed in the steps of Capcom, which put bits of real-world architecture found across Europe into Resident Evil 4, which was originally released over 16 years ago. \u201cI collected a great number of locations the game\u2019s developers use as source material,\u201d Marin told The Verge.\nFast forward to 2021, and Marin is now seven years into a project to remaster Resident Evil 4\u2019s blurry GameCube-era graphics into crisp HD, in part using high-resolution photos he\u2019s taken of everything from surfaces and doors to general architecture that seemed to have made their way into the original game. Even though Capcom published its own PC remaster in 2014, it wasn\u2019t Marin\u2019s idea of a true HD version of the game, so he and a small team have been poring through the game\u2019s files to faithfully update every texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots showing the original Resident Evil 4 and the improved graphics of the HD Project.\nAlbert Marin and Capcom\n\n\n\nIn some cases, they work with what Capcom already made, sharpening the images with a mix of off-the-shelf apps and custom-built tools. Other times, Marin is making hand-crafted textures based on high resolution stock photos or pictures that he\u2019s taken himself. If you own the Ultimate HD version of the game on Steam, you can actually test out an in-progress version of the texture pack right now. Eventually, every rock, wall, button, and dial will have been retouched by this small team of modders.\nThe fan-funded Resident Evil 4 HD Project is almost at the finish line and should be wrapped up later in 2021. Marin says he\u2019s amassed over 4,500 Photoshop files and put in more than 9,000 hours of work (just on his part) to get to this point.    \nI spoke with Marin over email about his experience tackling a project of this scale, balancing expectations from fans who are just as passionate about the game, how the team was able to deconstruct the game\u2019s files, and more.\nHow exactly do you remaster the visuals? Do you redraw textures from the ground up, or have a specialized way to increase the resolution of the original without degrading their quality?\nMost textures are re-created from scratch using some texture library images as a base. The original textures need to be analyzed several times in order to make sure the new source images match in terms of color, lighting, and even the material.\nFor example, a rock texture: It may sound like an easy challenge, and it is, if you don\u2019t have an original texture you need to be faithful to. You can\u2019t imagine how complicated it can be to find a rock surface that matches with the original among the hundreds of different kinds of rocks nature has to offer!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots showing the original Resident Evil 4 and the improved graphics of the HD Project.\nAlbert Marin and Capcom\n\n\n\nWhat sorts of applications and tech do you use to accomplish your goals with this project?\nA talented modder and coder, \u201cSon of Persia,\u201d helped us a lot: He developed most of the tools I use to edit 3D models, lights, effects, collision data, and much more. I found out how some files work, but I needed to edit in a hexadecimal editor manually. This means a single light\/effect would take hours to edit.\n\u201cSon of Persia\u201d took all my findings about these files and generated automated tools that would make this work way easier. And he also deciphered how other files of the game work and what they do, and he generated the needed tools to edit these kinds of files as well.\nWe also use Photoshop, 3ds Max, and dozens of custom tools courtesy of \u201cSon of Persia\u201d and other modders. These tools unpack and convert all the game files into editable data (mostly understandable .txt files and 3D files that can be opened with most 3D editors). Once the data is edited it can be repacked again with the same tools. But I have to admit sometimes I manually edit a few things in a hexadecimal editor, too.\n\u201cModding and remastering this game is also a game for me\u201d\nIs it intimidating to make certain adjustments to a game that has such a passionate fanbase, or are you confident in your changes?\nWe are on the safe side because one of the main goals of this project is to be faithful to the original. And here is where subjectivity plays an important role: Low resolution textures leave a lot to the imagination, and you know... every person\u2019s imagination is different!\nSometimes we receive complaints even when we use the exact same texture, but in HD resolutions, because the low-res textures looked like it was dirtier or muddy or something like that. But the HD re-creation looked too clean in comparison, depending on what the person interpreted when looking at the low-res surface.\nAnd then we have all the lighting and effects changes I\u2019ve done. Most of them are well-received, but I\u2019m aware my personal taste is playing a role to some degree, so I\u2019m always open to feedback and this is the reason I post all those videos and comparison images.\nI\u2019ve changed a lot of things because of the feedback we receive!\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlbert Marin standing in front of Raglan Castle, specifically, in front of the wall he says is used in a few Resident Evil titles.\n\nPhoto: Albert Marin\n\n\n\nWhat are some of the biggest and smallest changes your team has made to RE4 during this project?\nThe biggest change by far is an entire piece of area created from scratch in the Separate Ways mini-game. The transition between one room and the other made no sense. I combined the 3D structure of the connecting areas and I found out a portion of the path was missing.\nThe smallest changes are any small texture and small 3D improvement done here and there. In fact, there are hundreds of small edits I\u2019m sure most people won\u2019t ever notice.\nAs an example, I remember some design changes in certain ammo boxes. This PC port has a HD textures option. The HD textures are 95 percent an upscaled and filtered version of the original [GameCube] textures, but some of the textures are redone or slightly adjusted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarin\u2019s team restored some of Capcom\u2019s original texture work that had been lost in later ports, then enhanced it.\nImage: Albert Marin\n\n\nIn the image (above) you can see how they altered the TMP ammo box design. The \u201cJ\u201d and the wolf drawing on the side are different. So, while I was upscaling that texture I took the opportunity to restore the original design from previous versions of the game.\nWhat have been your favorite sections of the game to upscale textures for?\nThe castle area, by far, because I used a lot of pictures I took myself during the trips I did around Spain and Wales. It was really satisfying to identify and improve all those architectural surfaces!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Raglan Castle-inspired wall as it appears in the original game (left), and the team\u2019s version based on photography (right).\nAlbert Marin and Capcom\n\n\n\nWhat section(s) of the game required the most amount of work to remaster? \nThe laboratory and factory areas on the island are probably the most time-consuming in terms of texture and 3D retouching, because there are tons of weird and blurry control panels, medical and military devices, and cables. Any small inaccuracy becomes really apparent, unlike the organic textures of the village or the old architectural surfaces in the castle.\nIs your HD project focused strictly on visuals, or has there been work done to the sound quality and other parts of the game as well?\nUnfortunately I do not have enough sound knowledge to remaster the game\u2019s audio. Although I fixed some bugs, mostly related to wrong sounds playing in the wrong moment or low quality sounds during the Separate Ways campaign (shipped as part of the PS2 port and all ports following it).\nI also fixed some stage collision issues here and there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAI upscaling looks far better than the original texture, but not as good as what Marin and the team eventually accomplished manually.\nImage: Albert Marin\n\n\nYou currently accept donations to help fund the RE4 HD project, but do you plan to sell the finished project once it releases?\nNo, it will be for free. Modding and remastering this game is also a game for me.\nWhat sort of reception have you gotten from this project, and who do you hope to reach with it?\nIt surpasses anything I\u2019d imagined. I guess some people, sites, and communities have spread its existence. But after all, Resident Evil has a huge fanbase, so I guess it\u2019s quite understandable a few thousands of this fanbase is interested in the remaster process of one of the best games of all history.\nAbout our target audience, I\u2019d say, everyone who likes the remasters for the sake of the visual pleasure; or playing their favorite game you like with no trace of blurriness, or simply the people who like this kind of fan project but don\u2019t like the game at all!\nBecause this project is more about the journey than the final result. After all, it can\u2019t compete with any next-gen game in terms of visuals, no matter how crisp the textures are or how round the models look.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of Resident Evil 4\u2019s laboratory environments, with upscaled textures applied.\n\nImage: Albert Marin\n\n\nHave you worked in any capacity with Capcom (or any of its current or former employees) on this project?\nNo. We were in contact with them at the beginning. Someone at Capcom was interested in our project, and he took the time to send a planning document, but I guess the other Capcom people in Japan were not interested because the communication ended there. Other than that, there was no help on making the project.\nGiven that Capcom recently released the RE3 remake, it\u2019s likely that an RE4 remake is in development. Does your team worry about Capcom eventually stealing your thunder, so to speak, with an improved version of the game?\nNo, the remakes are really different games. Even now, the original Resident Evil 2 & 3 receive their own mods and visual improvements (Resident Evil 2 and 3 HD Seamless Project) They are different and complementary experiences. Just think about any Hollywood remake. Most of them don\u2019t hurt the original movie, and they are alternative visions of the older title.","Author":"Cameron Faulkner"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  1:42pm EST","Title":"NFTs, explained","Article":"There\u2019s nothing like an explosion of blockchain news to leave you thinking, \u201cUm\u2026 what\u2019s going on here?\u201d That\u2019s the feeling I\u2019ve experienced while reading about Grimes getting millions of dollars for NFTs or about Nyan Cat being sold as one. And by the time we all thought we sort of knew what the deal was, the founder of Twitter put an autographed tweet up for sale as an NFT. \nYou might be wondering: what is an NFT, anyhow?\nAfter literal hours of reading, I think I know. I also think I\u2019m going to cry.\nOkay, let\u2019s start with the basics:\nWhat is an NFT? What does NFT stand for?\nNon-fungible token.\nThat doesn\u2019t make it any clearer.\nRight, sorry. \u201cNon-fungible\u201d more or less means that it\u2019s unique and can\u2019t be replaced with something else. For example, a bitcoin is fungible \u2014 trade one for another bitcoin, and you\u2019ll have exactly the same thing. A one-of-a-kind trading card, however, is non-fungible. If you traded it for a different card, you\u2019d have something completely different. You gave up a Squirtle, and got a 1909 T206 Honus Wagner, which StadiumTalk calls \u201cthe Mona Lisa of baseball cards.\u201d (I\u2019ll take their word for it.)\nHow do NFTs work?\nAt a very high level, most NFTs are part of the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, like bitcoin or dogecoin, but its blockchain also supports these NFTs, which store extra information that makes them work differently from, say, an ETH coin. It is worth noting that other blockchains can implement their own versions of NFTs. (Some already have.)\nWhat\u2019s worth picking up at the NFT supermarket?\nNFTs can really be anything digital (such as drawings, music, your brain downloaded and turned into an AI), but a lot of the current excitement is around using the tech to sell digital art. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDogecoin isn\u2019t an NFT. But this GIF of a dogecoin is.\nGIF: NyanCat on OpenSea\n\n\n\nYou mean, like, people buying my good tweets?\nI don\u2019t think anyone can stop you, but that\u2019s not really what I meant. A lot of the conversation is about NFTs as an evolution of fine art collecting, only with digital art. \n(Side note, when coming up with the line \u201cbuying my good tweets,\u201d we were trying to think of something so silly that it wouldn\u2019t be a real thing. So of course the founder of Twitter would take a shot at it just days after we posted the article.)\nDo people really think this will become like art collecting?\nI\u2019m sure some people really hope so \u2014 like whoever paid almost $390,000 for a 50-second video by Grimes or the person who paid $6.6 million for a video by Beeple. Actually, one of Beeple\u2019s pieces was auctioned at Christie\u2019s, the famou\u2014\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYoink!\nImage: Beeple\n\n\n\nSorry, I was busy right-clicking on that Beeple video and downloading the same file the person paid millions of dollars for.\nWow, rude. But yeah, that\u2019s where it gets a bit awkward. You can copy a digital file as many times as you want, including the art that\u2019s included with an NFT.\nBut NFTs are designed to give you something that can\u2019t be copied: ownership of the work (though the artist can still retain the copyright and reproduction rights, just like with physical artwork). To put it in terms of physical art collecting: anyone can buy a Monet print. But only one person can own the original.\nNo shade to Beeple, but the video isn\u2019t really a Monet.\nWhat do you think of the $3,600 Gucci Ghost? Also, you didn\u2019t let me finish earlier. That image that Beeple was auctioning off at Christie\u2019s ended up selling for $69 million, which, by the way, is $15 million more than Monet\u2019s painting Nymph\u00e9as sold for in 2014.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis last sold for $3,600, but the current owner is asking for $16,300.\nGIF by Trevor Andrew\n\n\n\nWhoever got that Monet can actually appreciate it as a physical object. With digital art, a copy is literally as good as the original.\nBut the flex of owning an original Beeple...\nWhat\u2019s the point?\nThat really depends on whether you\u2019re an artist or a buyer. \nI\u2019m an artist.\nFirst off: I\u2019m proud of you. Way to go. You might be interested in NFTs because it gives you a way to sell work that there otherwise might not be much of a market for. If you come up with a really cool digital sticker idea, what are you going to do? Sell it on the iMessage App Store? No way.\nAlso, NFTs have a feature that you can enable that will pay you a percentage every time the NFT is sold or changes hands, making sure that if your work gets super popular and balloons in value, you\u2019ll see some of that benefit.\nI\u2019m a buyer.\nOne of the obvious benefits of buying art is it lets you financially support artists you like, and that\u2019s true with NFTs (which are way trendier than, like, Telegram stickers). Buying an NFT also usually gets you some basic usage rights, like being able to post the image online or set it as your profile picture. Plus, of course, there are bragging rights that you own the art, with a blockchain entry to back it up.\nNo, I meant I\u2019m a collector.\nAh, okay, yes. NFTs can work like any other speculative asset, where you buy it and hope that the value of it goes up one day, so you can sell it for a profit. I feel kind of dirty for talking about that, though.\nSo every NFT is unique?\nIn the boring, technical sense that every NFT is a unique token on the blockchain. But while it could be like a van Gogh, where there\u2019s only one definitive actual version, it could also be like a trading card, where there\u2019s 50 or hundreds of numbered copies of the same artwork.\nWho would pay hundreds of thousands of dollars for what basically amounts to a trading card?\nWell, that\u2019s part of what makes NFTs so messy. Some people treat them like they\u2019re the future of fine art collecting (read: as a playground for the mega-rich), and some people treat them like Pok\u00e9mon cards (where they\u2019re accessible to normal people but also a playground for the mega-rich). Speaking of Pok\u00e9mon cards, Logan Paul just sold some NFTs relating to a million-dollar box of the\u2014\nPlease stop. I hate where this is going.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ve activated my trap card (which sold for $17,000).\nImage by Logan Paul\n\n\nYeah, he sold NFT video clips, which are just clips from a video you can watch on YouTube anytime you want, for up to $20,000. He also sold NFTs of a Logan Paul Pok\u00e9mon card.\nWho paid $20,000 for a video clip of Logan Paul?!\nA fool and their money are soon parted, I guess?\nIt would be hilarious if Logan Paul decided to sell 50 more NFTs of the exact same video.\nLinkin Park\u2019s Mike Shinoda (who also sold some NFTs that included a song) actually talked about that. It\u2019s totally a thing someone could do if they were, in his words, \u201can opportunist crooked jerk.\u201d I\u2019m not saying that Logan Paul is that, just that you should be careful who you buy from.\nCan I buy this article as an NFT?\nNo, but technically anything digital could be sold as an NFT. deadmau5 has sold digital animated stickers. William Shatner has sold Shatner-themed trading cards (one of which was apparently an X-ray of his teeth).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one I like. Maybe not for $700, but...\nImage by deadmau5 and Mad Dog Jones\n\n\nGross. Actually, could I buy someone\u2019s teeth as an NFT?\nThere have been some attempts at connecting NFTs to real-world objects, often as a sort of verification method. Nike has patented a method to verify sneakers\u2019 authenticity using an NFT system, which it calls CryptoKicks. But so far, I haven\u2019t found any teeth, no. I\u2019m scared to look.\nLook? Where? \nThere are several marketplaces that have popped up around NFTs, which allow people to buy and sell. These include OpenSea, Rarible, and Grimes\u2019 choice, Nifty Gateway, but there are plenty of others.\nI\u2019ve heard there were kittens involved. Tell me about the kittens.\nNFTs really became technically possible when the Ethereum blockchain added support for them as part of a new standard. Of course, one of the first uses was a game called CryptoKitties that allowed users to trade and sell virtual kittens. Thank you, internet.\nI love kittens.\nNot as much as the person who paid over $170,000 for one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy face when I\u2019m worth $170K.\nImage: Cryptokitties.co\n\n\nArrrrrggggg!\nSame. But in my opinion, the kittens show that one of the most interesting aspects of NFTs (for those of us not looking to create a digital dragon\u2019s lair of art) is how they can be used in games. There are already games that let you have NFTs as items. One even sells virtual plots of land as NFTs. There could be opportunities for players to buy a unique in-game gun or helmet or whatever as an NFT, which would be a flex that most people could actually appreciate.\nCould I pull off a museum heist to steal NFTs?\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image is not an NFT. Yet.\nImage: Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers\n\n\n\nThat depends. Part of the allure of blockchain is that it stores a record of each time a transaction takes place, making it harder to steal and flip than, say, a painting hanging in a museum. That said, cryptocurrencies have been stolen before, so it really would depend on how the NFT is being stored and how much work a potential victim would be willing to put in to get their stuff back.\nNote: Please don\u2019t steal.\nShould I be worried about digital art being around in 500 years?\nProbably. Bit rot is a real thing: image quality deteriorates, file formats can\u2019t be opened anymore, websites go down, people forget the password to their wallets. But physical art in museums is also shockingly fragile. \nI want to maximize my blockchain use. Can I buy NFTs with cryptocurrencies?\nYes. Probably. A lot of the marketplaces accept Ethereum. But technically, anyone can sell an NFT, and they could ask for whatever currency they want.\nWill trading my Logan Paul NFTs contribute to global warming and melt Greenland?\nIt\u2019s definitely something to look out for. Since NFTs use the same blockchain technology as some energy-hungry cryptocurrencies, they also end up using a lot of electricity. There are people working on mitigating this issue, but so far, most NFTs are still tied to cryptocurrencies that generate a lot of greenhouse gas emissions. There have been a few cases where artists have decided to not sell NFTs or to cancel future drops after hearing about the effects they could have on climate change. Thankfully, one of my colleagues has really dug into it, so you can read this piece to get a fuller picture.\n\n\nThe NFT market has grown,As eight-figure auctions have shown.The overall price isA worse climate crisisFor art you pretend that you own.\u2014 Limericking (@Limericking) March 15, 2021\n\n\n\nCan I build an underground art cave \/ bunker to store my NFTs?\nWell, like cryptocurrencies, NFTs are stored in digital wallets (though it is worth noting that the wallet does specifically have to be NFT-compatible). You could always put the wallet on a computer in an underground bunker, though.\nAre you tired of typing \u201cNFT\u201d?\nYes.\nUpdate March 5th, 8:07PM ET: Added the news that Jack Dorsey was selling one of his tweets as an NFT because I originally made a joke and cannot believe it actually happened.\nUpdate March 11th, 1:42PM ET: Added the news that Beeple\u2019s piece sold for $69 million and added more information to the climate change section.\nUpdate March 15th, 1:30PM ET: Added a link to our piece on the environmental impact of NFTs and updated some of the language to reflect some recent research.

With the click of a button, Dashlane\u2019s password changer can update your passwords on supported sites without requiring you to visit the site and change your credentials yourself.\nThis GIF shows how it works: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new version of the password changer works on-device, which should mean that websites are less likely to flag the attempt to change the password as unauthorized. And if the new password changer runs into something like an entry form for a two-factor authentication code, it can tell a user that they\u2019ll have to do that step manually so that Dashlane can take care of the rest, like you can see in the GIF below. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s one big caveat, though: the new password changer doesn\u2019t work with every website just yet. Dashlane\u2019s goal for the beta is that every customer will be able to change at least two passwords in their vault with the tool to start, and the company says it works with approximately 100 sites right now, \u201cincluding popular social media, streaming, shopping, and news sites.\u201d\nDashlane first introduced a one-click password changer in 2014, but it started to work less reliably over time, Derek Snyder, Dashlane\u2019s chief product officer, said in an interview with The Verge. The older version of the password changer is managed through Dashlane\u2019s servers, which not only is a potential privacy risk but could also create issues with the actual password changing process. For example, a website might view Dashlane trying to change a user\u2019s password as an unauthorized login since the change attempt was coming from a different place than where the user was located.\nOne benefit of a one-click password changer is that, in theory, it\u2019s easy to change a compromised login quickly. If Dashlane becomes aware of a breach in a service used by a significant number of users, the company\u2019s goal is to have a new one-click password recipe ready \u201cwithin a matter of hours,\u201d Snyder said. That way, people can ideally act on a password breach notification swiftly with just a few clicks. (Dashlane maintains a database of compromised websites that you can check here.)\nAnd if a website changes the password flow in some way that breaks Dashlane\u2019s one-click tool, the company\u2019s engineers can remove the \u201crecipe\u201d for the password change from Dashlane so they can fix it, Snyder said. If you need to change your password in the interim, you\u2019ll have to change it the old-fashioned way.\nDashlane is also launching an autofill engine powered by machine learning\nDashlane is also introducing a new autofill engine in beta that\u2019s powered by machine learning. The idea is that Dashlane\u2019s machine learning algorithms can learn how to recognize fields to fill in and more quickly and accurately fill in the content from your Dashlane vault onto the page. Dashlane says the new engine should work across all sites once it has rolled out to you.\nBoth features will be available to users in Dashlane\u2019s beta program, which you can sign up for here. The password changer will be available to any user in the beta today, and the company will be rolling it out to non-beta users over time. The new autofill engine will be available to beta users in about a week and over time to more users. \nUsers on both Dashlane\u2019s paid tier and free tier, which only works with one device and only lets you save credentials for up to 50 accounts, will be able to use the new autofill engine \u201calways and forever,\u201d according to Snyder. The new one-click password changer will be available to both paid and free Dashlane users during the beta, but the company still hasn\u2019t decided whether it will be a paid-only option when it\u2019s widely available, Snyder said. Both features are set to be out of beta later this year.\nDashlane\u2019s changes arrive just days before popular password manager LastPass will restrict its free users to accessing their passwords on only one category of device, either mobile or computer. If you\u2019re looking for an alternative, perhaps the convenience of Dashlane\u2019s updated one-click password changer and its new autofill engine could make it the choice for you.\nIf you want to check out other free alternatives to LastPass and Dashlane, check out our guide.

It\u2019s a shapeshifting wonderbox that can change its own logic to make itself run like countless other machines as accurately as possible. From old arcade boards to early PCs to vintage consoles, MiSTer developers are devoted to helping it turn into an ever-expanding range of hardware.\nIf you\u2019ve ever wanted to use computer software or hardware that is no longer available for sale, you\u2019ve probably run into emulation before. It\u2019s a huge field that often involves a ton of people working on a technically challenging feat: how to write software that lets one computer run code that was written for another. But there\u2019s only so much traditional emulators can do. There are always inherent compromises and complexities involved in getting your current hardware to run software it was never designed to handle. Emulated operating systems or video games often encounter slowdown, latency, and bugs you\u2019d never have encountered with the original devices. So what if there was a way to alter the hardware itself? \nWell, that\u2019s MiSTer. It\u2019s an open-source project built upon field-programmable gate array (FPGA) technology, which means it makes use of hardware that can be reconfigured after the fact. While traditional CPUs are fixed from the point of manufacture, FPGAs can be reprogrammed to work as if they came right off the conveyor belt with the actual silicon you want to use.\nWhat this means is, you\u2019re not tricking a processor into believing it\u2019s something else, you\u2019re setting it up to run that way from the start. A MiSTer system can theoretically run software from the NES to the Neo Geo, to the Apple II or Acorn Archimedes, and deliver responsive, near-as-dammit accurate performance next to what you\u2019d get from the actual devices.\nOf course, it\u2019s not as easy as that makes it sound. In order to program an FPGA to act like a computer from three decades ago, you have to intimately understand the original hardware. And that\u2019s what makes MiSTer one of the technically coolest DIY projects going today, building on the knowledge of developers around the globe.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe DE10-Nano sandwiched between the I\/O and USB hub boards.\n\n\n\nFPGAs aren\u2019t new technology. Two early companies in the field (sorry) were Altera, now owned by Intel, and Xilinx, now part of AMD. The two have competed since the 1980s for market share in programmable logic devices, largely serving enterprise customers. One of the biggest advantages of FPGAs on an industrial scale is that companies can iterate their software design on hardware before they need to manufacture the final silicon. FPGAs are widely used to develop embedded systems, for example, because the software and the hardware can be designed near-concurrently.\nYou might be familiar with FPGAs if you\u2019ve come across Analogue\u2019s boutique console clones, like the Mega Sg and the Super Nt. Those use FPGAs programmed in a certain way to replicate a single, specific piece of hardware, so you can use your original physical cartridges with them and get an experience that\u2019s very close to the actual consoles.\nThe MiSTer project is built around more accessible FPGA hardware than you\u2019d find in commercial or enterprise applications. The core of the system is an FPGA board called the DE10-Nano, produced by another Intel-owned company called Terasic that\u2019s based out of Taiwan. It was originally intended for students as a way to teach themselves how to work with FPGAs.\nThe DE10-Nano looks somewhat similar to a Raspberry Pi \u2014 it\u2019s a tiny motherboard that ships without a case and is designed to be expanded. The hardware includes an Altera Cyclone V with two ARM Cortex-A9 CPU cores, 1GB of DDR3 SDRAM, an HDMI out, a microSD card slot, a USB-A port, and Ethernet connectivity. It runs a Linux-based OS out of the box and sells for about $135, or $99 to students.\nMiSTer is inspired by MiST, an earlier project that made use of an Altera FPGA board to recreate the Atari ST. But the DE10-Nano is cheaper, more powerful, and expandable, which is why project leader Alexey Melnikov used it as the basis for MiSTer when development started a few years back. Melnikov also designed MiSTer-specific daughterboards that enhance the DE10-Nano\u2019s capability and make a finished machine a lot more versatile; the designs are open-source, so anyone is free to manufacture and sell them.\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetail shots of the DE10-Nano.\n\nYou can run MiSTer on a single DE10-Nano, but it\u2019s not recommended, because the board alone will only support a few of the cores available. (A \u201ccore\u201d is a re-creation of a specific console or computer designed to run on the MiSTer platform.) The one upgrade that should be considered essential is a 128MB stick of SDRAM, which gives MiSTer enough memory at the right speed to run anything released for the platform to date.\nBeyond that, you\u2019ll probably want a case, assuming you\u2019d rather not run open circuitry exposed to the elements. There are various case designs available, many of which are intended for use with other MiSTer-specific add-ons that vertically attach to the DE10-Nano. An I\/O board isn\u2019t necessary for most cores, for example, but it adds a VGA port along with digital and analog audio out, which is useful for various setups. (A lot of MiSTer users prefer to hook up their systems to CRT TVs to make the most of the authentic output and low latency.) You can add a heatsink or a fan, which can be a good idea if you want to run the system for extended periods of time. And there\u2019s a USB hub board that adds seven USB-A ports.\nCustomization is part of the fun with MiSTer\nFor my setup, I ordered the DE10-Nano, a 128MB SDRAM stick, a VGA I\/O board with a fan, a USB hub board, and a case designed for that precise selection of hardware. These largely came from different sources and took varying amounts of time to show up; you can order the DE10-Nano from countless computer retailers, but other MiSTer accessories involve diving into a cottage industry of redesigns and resellers. Half of my parts arrived in a battered box from Portugal filled with shredded paper and loosely attached bubble wrap.\nMiSTer accessories are based on Melnikov\u2019s original designs, but since the project is open-source, many sellers customize their own versions. My case, for example, includes a patch cable that hooks directly into the I\/O board to control its lighting, while some others require you to route the LEDs yourself. The USB board, meanwhile, came with a bridge to the DE10-Nano that seemed to be a different height from most others, which meant I had to improvise a little with screw placements. Nothing I ordered came with instructions, so it did take some time to figure out what should go where, but everything worked fine in the end. The only other thing I had to do was go buy a small hex screwdriver for the final screws in the case. \nThat\u2019s part of the fun with MiSTer. There\u2019s a base specification that everything works around, but you\u2019re still ultimately assembling your own FPGA computer, and you can adjust the build as much or as little as you want. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nAnalogue\u2019s console clones are a way to preserve gaming\u2019s past\n\nOnce your hardware is set, you need to install the MiSTer software. There are a few ways to do this, and you\u2019ll want to dig around forums and GitHub for a while so you know what you\u2019re doing, but the method I went with was simple in the end \u2014 essentially, you format your microSD card with an installer package, put it into the DE10-Nano, plug in an Ethernet cable and a USB keyboard, power on the system, and it\u2019ll download all of the available cores. Your SD card will then be set up to boot the MiSTer OS directly, and you can run another script to make sure everything\u2019s updated with the most recent versions.\nThe MiSTer OS is very simple, with a default background that looks like pixelated TV static and a basic menu in a monospaced font that lets you select from lists of console and computer cores. The first thing I did was load some old Game Boy Advance ROMs I dumped well over a decade ago, because for some reason Nintendo doesn\u2019t want to sell them for the Switch. (Please sell them for the Switch, Nintendo.) The performance felt about as authentic as I could\u2019ve expected, except for the fact that I was looking at a 4K TV instead of a tiny screen.\nMy main reason for getting into MiSTer is to have a hardware-based way to access the parts of computer history that I missed, or to revisit forgotten platforms that I was around for. I knew that computer systems like the Apple II and the Amiga were big gaps in my knowledge, so it\u2019s great to have a little box that can run like either of them on command. I\u2019ve also been getting into the MSX platform, which was popular in Japan in the \u201980s. My next rainy-day project is to work on an install of RISC OS, the Acorn operating system that was on the first computers I ever used at school in the UK. (You can actually still buy licensed ROM copies of various versions of the OS, which was a neat surprise.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA fully assembled MiSTer system in a case.\n\n\n\nMiSTer development is a vibrant scene. Melnikov has a Patreon that\u2019s updated several times a week with improvements he\u2019s made to various cores, but there are lots of other people contributing to the project on a daily or weekly basis. A colleague introduced me to the work of Jose Tejada, for example, who\u2019s based in Spain and has made a ton of progress on replicating old Capcom arcade machine boards. There\u2019s another project aiming to get the original PlayStation running, marking the biggest step yet into 3D hardware on MiSTer.\nFPGAs are often talked about as if they\u2019re a silver bullet for perfect emulation, but that\u2019s really not the case \u2014 at least, not without a lot of effort. Anything that runs perfectly on MiSTer, or as close to perfectly as is otherwise imperceptible, is the result of a ton of work by talented programmers who have spent time figuring out the original hardware and applying the knowledge to their cores. Just read this post from the FPGA PSX Project about what it took to get Ridge Racer running on MiSTer, as well as the assessment of how far they have to go. The cores can vary in quality, accuracy, and state of completion, but a lot of them are still under active development and huge strides have been made in the past couple of years.\nAnalogue lead hardware engineer Kevin Horton spoke to The Verge in 2019 about the work that went into re-creating the Sega Genesis for the Mega Sg console. The process took him nine months, including two-and-a-half months figuring out the CPU at the heart of the console. \u201cI didn\u2019t know Genesis very well, and knew literally nothing about the 68000 CPU at all!\u201d he said. \u201cThis was my first foray into both things and probably slowed the process down since I had to learn it all as I went.\u201d \n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetail shots of the MiSTer system in a case. \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, Horton confirmed the accuracy of his work by directly connecting a 68000 to an FPGA and comparing their performance on a test that ran for a week straight. It demonstrates the lengths that FPGA enthusiasts go to in pursuit of the most accurate results possible, but what makes MiSTer special is that this is largely the work of hobbyists. No one\u2019s paying anyone a salary to make incremental tweaks to the performance of the arcade version of Bionic Commando, but that\u2019s where Tejada has directed his passion.\nMiSTer is an important project because it speaks to the concept of preservation in a way that all too often goes underserved by the technology industry. The project makes the argument that the way we run software is as big a part of our experience as its content. Yes, you can port or emulate or re-release software to run on modern hardware, but there\u2019s always going to be a compromise in the underlying code that moves the pixels in front of your eyes.\nOf course, that might sound like a pretty niche concern for anyone who\u2019s satisfied with, say, the emulated software you can run in a browser at Archive.org. I\u2019m often one of those people myself \u2014 emulation can be great, and it\u2019s hard to beat the convenience. But the MiSTer project is an incredible effort all the same. I\u2019ll never have a shred of the technical knowledge possessed by MiSTer developers, but I\u2019m grateful for their effort. Once you build your own system, it\u2019s hard not to feel invested in the work that goes into it; MiSTer is a never-ending pursuit of perfection, and there\u2019s something beautiful about that.\nPhotography by Sam Byford \/ The Verge","Author":"Sam Byford"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  9:52am EST","Title":"How to create a signature for PDF documents on a PC","Article":"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic closed most offices, more and more official papers were being turned into PDF documents.

Maybe it was Ryu from Street Fighter singing the \u201cWitch Doctor\u201d or the last three heads of the US Federal Reserve miming in unison to Rick Astley\u2019s \u201cNever Going to Give You Up.\u201d Each clip features exaggerated facial expressions and uncanny, sometimes nightmarish animation. They\u2019re stupid, fun, and offer a useful look at the current state of deepfakes. \nIt\u2019s certainly getting quicker and easier to make AI-generated fakes, but the more convincing they are, the more work is needed. The realistic Tom Cruise deepfakes that went viral on TikTok, for example, required an experienced VFX artist, a top-flight impersonator, and weeks of preparation to pull off. One-click fakes that can be created with zero effort and expertise, by comparison, still look like those made by the Wombo app and will continue to do so for the immediate future. In the short term, at least, deepfakes are going to be obviously fabricated and instant meme-bait. \n\n\n@maximilian_ I'm sorry capcom what have I done pic.twitter.com\/5ogqveykl4\u2014 Hero101 (@Hero10108253313) March 10, 2021\n\n\n\nThe Wombo app launched late last month from Canada after a short development process. \u201cBack in August 2020 I had the idea for Wombo while smoking a joint with my roommate on the roof,\u201d app creator and Wombo CEO Ben-Zion Benkhin tells The Verge. Releasing the product was \u201can enormous joy,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve been following the AI space, following the meme space, following the deepfake space, and just saw the opportunity to do something cool.\u201d In just a few weeks, Benkhin estimates the app has seen some 2 million downloads. \n\u201cI had the idea for Wombo while smoking a joint with my roommate\u201d\nWombo is free and easy to use. Just snap a picture of your face or upload an image from your camera roll, and push a button to have the image lip-sync to one of a handful of meme-adjacent songs. The app\u2019s software will work its magic on anything that even vaguely resembles a face and many things that don\u2019t. Although similar apps in the past have been dogged by privacy fears, Benkhin is adamant users\u2019 data is safe. \u201cWe take privacy really seriously,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the data gets deleted and we don\u2019t share it or send it to anyone else.\u201d\n\n      \n\n\n \n  View this post on Instagram\n\n \n   \n\n  \n\n   \n\n   \nA post shared by fleshman (@ctrlctrl)\n\n\n\nThe app\u2019s name comes from esports slang, specifically Super Smash Bros. Melee. \u201cIf a player lands like a crazy combination then the casters will start yelling \u2018Wombo Combo! Wombo Combo!\u2019\u201d says Benkhin. True to these origins, Wombo has proved particularly popular with gamers who\u2019ve used it to animate characters from titles like League of Legends, Fallout: New Vegas, and Dragon Age. \u201cI did some digging into [the origins of the slang],\u201d says Benkhin, \u201cand apparently there was some pizza place that started all this, where they would put a shit-ton of toppings on all their pizza and call it a Wombo Combo.\u201d \nBenkhin says the app works by morphing faces using predefined choreography. He and his team shot the base video for each song in his studio (\u201cwhich is really just a room in my apartment\u201d) and then use these to animate each image. \u201cWe steal the motions from their face and apply it to your photo,\u201d he says. The app is also an example of the fast-paced world of AI research, where new techniques can become consumer products in a matter of weeks. Benkhin notes that the software is built \u201con top of existing work\u201d but with subsequent tweaks and improvements that make it \u201cour own proprietary model.\u201d \n\n\nHave this cursed abomination I made using the Wombo app before I go to sleep pic.twitter.com\/YrRyJKSkj3\u2014 Starolu Platichu (@StaroluPlatichu) March 11, 2021\n\n\n\nCurrently, Wombo offers just 14 short clips of songs to lip-sync with, but Benkhin says he plans to expand these options soon. When asked whether the app has the proper licenses for the music it uses, he demures to answer but says the team is working on it. \nAs with TikTok, though, it seems the reach offered by Wombo could help ameliorate license-holders\u2019 worries about rights. Wombo has already been approached by artists wanting to get their music on the app, says Benkhin, and it\u2019s likely this could offer a revenue stream in addition to the current premium tier (which pays for priority processing and no in-app ads). \u201cIt\u2019s going to give [artists] a completely new way of engaging audiences,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives them this new viral marketing tool.\u201d \nWombo is far from the first app to use machine learning to create quick and fun deepfakes. Others include ReFace and FaceApp. But it\u2019s the latest example of what will be an ever-more prominent trend, as deepfake apps become the latest meme templates, allowing users to mash together favorite characters, trending songs, choreographed dances, public figures, and so much more. The future of deepfakes will definitely be memeified.","Author":"James Vincent"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  9:00am EST","Title":"Facebook is testing a way for creators to make money through Stories: sticker ads","Article":"Facebook introduced Stories to its platform four years ago, mostly as a way to encourage people to post content that wasn\u2019t highly produced or necessarily photogenic. Now, it\u2019s giving some users a chance to make money through that content. The company announced a test today that\u2019ll allow some creators to place ads that look like stickers into their stories and receive a cut of the resulting revenue. The initial test is \u201cvery small,\u201d Facebook says, but it hopes to expand it \u201csoon\u201d and then apply the technology to all short-form videos on Facebook. \nIn a chat with The Verge, Yoav Arnstein, director of product management, says he can\u2019t share creator or advertiser partners because the test is still in the early conceptual phase. He said the broader idea, though, is to give advertisers a natural place to fit their content, so, for example, if someone posts a video from Yosemite National Park, a sticker could advertise a local business. The contextual relevance will likely be key to making these advertisements successful, Arnstein says.\nThe story stickers are only one of the company\u2019s various updates to its creator platform today. It\u2019s also making its usual in-stream ads available for shorter videos. Previously, only three-minute or longer videos could monetize with these ads, but now, one-minute-long videos can receive ads, which will be placed 30 seconds into the content. Videos longer than three minutes can place ads as soon as 45 seconds into the programming. \nTo qualify for these in-stream ads, pages that publish them must have 600,000 total minutes viewed from any combination of video uploads \u2014 on-demand, live, and previously live \u2014 in the last 60 days, as well as five or more active video uploads or previously live videos. Meanwhile, live video creators now must have 60,000 live minutes viewed in the last 60 days to monetize through in-stream ads, in addition to meeting the video-on-demand program requirements. \nFacebook is also spending $7 million to promote its Stars feature, which lets viewers of live content tip with virtual stars, which each pay a creator a cent. The company will make free Stars available during certain live streams, and viewers can them send to the videos\u2019 hosts. The team will also introduce virtual gifts that viewers can send. \n\u201cWe want to enable more people to actually go and experience this delight of actually going and supporting a creator, and we think this is a relatively new behavior that we want to make more ubiquitous across the app, and we think this is a great way to do that,\u201d Arnstein says about why Facebook is investing in the Stars. \u201cWe think that can help also incentivize creators to experiment more with the type of content and the type of engagement directly with fans that will actually enable and incentivize this type of direct support from fans.\u201d\nFinally, Facebook is expanding its paid live events to 24 additional countries and its fan subscriptions to 10 more countries. The company won\u2019t collect revenue from either of those features through at least August 2021.\nAll of these various announcements clearly add up to the idea that Facebook wants to monetize as much creator content as possible through ads. The Stories sticker has potentially the biggest implications, particularly for Instagram, and could usher in a world that\u2019s slightly less focused on full-screen ads and more on those integrated into the content itself.","Author":"Ashley Carman"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  8:58am EST","Title":"Trump\u2019s Moon program survived a transfer of power, so what\u2019s next?","Article":"The Trump administration\u2019s Moon-to-Mars program has already dodged the fate of many past presidential space programs: cancellation under new leadership. Last month, White House press secretary Jen Psaki announced the Biden administration\u2019s support for Artemis, NASA\u2019s flagship lunar agenda.\nIt was a rare passing of the baton between two administrations at odds with one another in virtually every other area. And it quelled some industry fears that Biden would shelve the moonshot plan entirely. While still in its infancy, the Artemis program unleashed a wave of industry momentum, partially thanks to an energizing, yet wildly unrealistic target date of 2024 for planting boots on the Moon.\nTo get a sense of what\u2019s next for Artemis and NASA, The Verge spoke with Bhavya Lal, NASA\u2019s acting chief of staff and currently the agency\u2019s most senior Biden appointee. \nArtemis survived the transfer of power \u2014 what now? \nThe program is getting a thorough review. The group of eight scientists and space policy experts tasked with reviewing NASA for Biden\u2019s transition team lifted the hood on Trump\u2019s speedy moonshot plan, announced by then-Vice President Mike Pence in early 2019. The experts came up with a list of things within Artemis that should stay in and things that should stay out to inform the NASA team\u2019s review.\n\u201cWe weren\u2019t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.\u201d\n\u201cOne thing that was absolutely in was continuity of purpose,\u201d says Lal, who has advised past administrations on space policy and was the Biden team\u2019s top space expert during the transition. \u201cWe weren\u2019t going to just throw away everything that had happened in the last many years and start over.\u201d\nLal joined NASA in February and is now helping lead the ongoing Artemis review inside the agency, carrying out the guidance she helped draft during the transition. \nThat review covers every pillar of Artemis, including the agency\u2019s long-delayed and staggeringly over-budget Space Launch System (SLS), the behemoth rocket that will launch the first astronaut crews to the Moon in the Orion capsule. It also includes reviewing the program\u2019s timeline, international partnerships, and coming up with a budget that Congress will like. The review will also refine planned activities on the Moon and identify spots where more commercial activities can get involved, Lal says.\nNothing is set in stone yet. The review is ongoing, and Biden, almost two months into his presidency, has yet to pick his NASA administrator. That\u2019s no surprise \u2014 it took Trump nearly eight months to nominate his administrator, Jim Bridenstine, and almost another eight months to win Senate confirmation. It was four months before Barack Obama named Charles Bolden, and about ten months before George Bush tapped Sean O\u2019Keefe.\nGetting to the Moon \u2014 just not by 2024\nNASA aims to continue its investment in SLS and Orion while keeping an eye on private sector rockets for help if needed. \u201cSLS and Orion will be providing initial transportation to and from lunar orbit beyond Artemis, and any proven commercial transportation can make up gaps if there are any,\u201d Lal says.\nBy the time the Boeing-built SLS flies for the first time (likely sometime next year, almost three years later than planned), the agency will have spent nearly $20 billion on the program, NASA\u2019s inspector general reported last year, with each launch thereafter coming out to about $2 billion.\nCheaper commercial rockets built by firms like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and the United Launch Alliance exist but currently are only poised to launch uncrewed pieces of the Artemis program to space. SpaceX\u2019s Falcon Heavy rocket will launch the first two elements of NASA\u2019s Lunar Gateway, a planned space station orbiting the Moon.\nWhere possible, NASA needs to \u201cmaintain multiple providers of launch vehicles, landers, spacecraft, across the enterprise so the US isn\u2019t overly reliant on one system or provider,\u201d Lal says. That\u2019s the spirit set out in NASA\u2019s human lunar landing system program, the centerpiece of Artemis that aims to pick two different landers capable of ferrying astronauts to the lunar surface.\nWith short funding from Congress, \u201c2024 wasn\u2019t realistic.\u201d\nBut Congress, though roundly supportive of the Artemis program, balked at the Trump administration\u2019s request for $3.3 billion to fund speedy development of those landers. Instead, it gave NASA $850 million for lander development, pounding the last nail in the coffin for Trump\u2019s 2024 goal, which many in the space industry viewed as unachievable. \nBiden\u2019s NASA will set a more manageable timetable, Lal says. \u201cOne of the transition team findings was that 2024, given the appropriations from Congress at least in the last two years, 2024 wasn\u2019t realistic.\u201d Setting a new date is tied to coming up with a palatable budget for Congress, \u201cwhich is a question mark\u201d at this point, Lal says.\nInternational partnerships, with Artemis and beyond\n\u201cHonoring commitments made to international partners\u201d was a key principle of the transition team\u2019s findings, says Lal, whether on the International Space Station or in the Artemis Accords, a set of multilateral agreements with US allies that aims to set legal standards of behavior in space. Those partners include Russia, a US adversary but a longtime NASA partner on the ISS, where the shared goal of keeping an orbital laboratory healthy supersedes the messy tensions back on Earth.\nBut the NASA-Russia relationship is changing. Roscosmos, Russia\u2019s space agency, has been reluctant to extend its alliance with NASA to the Moon, and last year the US sought to exclude Russia from early talks on the Artemis Accords. This week, Russia made good on its claims to ditch Artemis by announcing a new agreement with China to build a rival Moon base and space station in lunar orbit, cementing a new front in an increasingly polarized race into deep space.\nNASA is courting its own allies for Artemis, but it\u2019s barred from collaborating with China, thanks to a 2011 law called the Wolf Amendment, named after the now-retired Rep. Frank Wolf (R-VA). But as Beijing ups its game on the Moon, some of Biden\u2019s space advisors have argued against the Chinese exclusion policy. \u201cTrying to exclude them I think is a failing strategy,\u201d former astronaut Pam Melroy told Politico last year, before joining Biden\u2019s NASA transition team.\nLal tamps down prospects of NASA-China cooperation under Biden\u2019s NASA: \u201cI don\u2019t expect China collaborations, at least on the Artemis program, in any way shape or form.\u201d\nShe says the NASA-Russia relationship, on the other hand, should continue for the foreseeable future. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be collaborating with them in deep space activities.\u201d Despite Russia bowing out of NASA\u2019s Lunar Gateway program, NASA said in a statement to The Verge on Wednesday that \u201cthey did offer to continue exploring interoperability and we welcome such a discussion.\u201d\nInternational relations could extend to NASA\u2019s climate science operations, a quieter side of the space agency that is expected to grow under Biden. Last month, NASA\u2019s Acting Administrator Steve Jurczyk had a phone call with Russia\u2019s space chief Dmitry Rogozin, where Jurczyk discussed NASA\u2019s \u201cfocus on climate change studies with the help of space technology,\u201d according to a Roscosmos statement. Rogozin \u201csupported the idea of cooperating in this field,\u201d the statement said.\nLal says it is too early to discuss what specific plans are in the works for boosting NASA\u2019s role in Biden\u2019s sweeping climate agenda. But she says it\u2019s not just about expanding current programs or upping the workload for NASA\u2019s existing fleet of weather satellites \u2014 it\u2019s also about starting new programs on both domestic and international fronts. \n\u201cClimate is an area where we\u2019re joined at the hip,\u201d she says. Like the space station, where astronaut safety overrides geopolitics, \u201cit may be necessary to even work with some of our adversaries\u201d on an agreement for sharing crucial climate data.","Author":"Joey Roulette"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 12:00pm EST","Title":"Google Maps will soon let you draw on a map to fix it","Article":"If you\u2019ve ever been frustrated by a road simply not existing on Google Maps, the company\u2019s now making it easier than ever to add it.

You can find a pair of earbuds at nearly every price point with a range of different features sprinkled throughout. Being within a particular ecosystem, such as AirPods for iOS users or the Galaxy Buds Live for Samsung\u2019s users, is an easy way to choose earbuds that are right for you. Anker doesn\u2019t exactly have a phone of its own to sell alongside its Liberty line of earbuds, so its strategy is to deliver desirable features at a competitive price.\nThe $129.99 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro buds do a lot of things well, but so do a lot of other earbuds at this price. It\u2019s their competitive active noise cancellation and well-designed app that helps them stand out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur review of \nAnker Liberty Air 2 Pro\n\n\nVerge Score\n8.5 out of 10\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood Stuff\n\nGood ANC for a competitive price\nMany ear tip sizes for finding the best fit\nEasy-to-use, helpful app\n\n\n\nBad Stuff\n\nTreble-heavy sound\nLarge case\nPassthrough sound feature isn\u2019t as good as Apple\u2019s\n\n\n\n\nBuy for $129.99 from Amazon\nBuy for $129.99 from Best Buy\nBuy for $129.99 from Anker\n\n\n\nThe buds themselves are the same stemmed design with a silicone ear tip as Apple\u2019s AirPods Pro. (I guess the name isn\u2019t the only way Anker took inspiration from Apple.) The Liberty Air 2 Pro have a gold fan-like cover over their speakers, which serves no purpose other than looking cool, and a textured, matte finish. They come in \u201conyx black,\u201d \u201ctitanium white,\u201d \u201csapphire blue,\u201d and \u201ccrystal pink.\u201d Included in the box are nine different-sized silicone ear tips, ranging from XXXS to XL, to create the best seal and hopefully keep movement in your ear canal from happening. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberty Air 2 Pro come in black, white, blue, and pink.\n\n\nFit is extremely important in earbuds, not only for ANC but also for the best sound quality experience, especially in the lower frequencies. To confirm you have chosen the best-sized tips, Anker has a Tip Fit Test within the Soundcore app. The app plays about 10 seconds of ringtone-esque orchestral music, then displays a \u201cgood seal\u201d or \u201cbad seal\u201d result for each earbud. (Yes, it\u2019s basically just like what Apple does with the AirPods Pro. Inspiration.)\nThere is also an audio test called HearID that claims to map your personal hearing sensitivity at multiple frequencies to best tailor the EQ settings for you. It plays about 30 different tones per ear and asks you to confirm if you can hear the tone or not. Next, you are presented with a graph of your results and an EQ preset saved to the app. My test resulted in deep bass and less treble, which did make my music sound fuller. \nBoth the fit tests and EQ settings test are something several other earbud makers are doing these days, and although not everyone finds these tests useful, I appreciate having the option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are nine different-sized silicone ear tips, ranging from XXXS to XL, included in the box.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Liberty Air 2 Pro case slides open.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a decorative gold fan-like cover over the earbud\u2019s speakers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case, large and almost stone-like in appearance, slides to open and close with a satisfying click. It most closely resembles the case of the Galaxy Buds Pro \u2014 it\u2019s longer than it is tall \u2014 but its larger size makes it not as pocketable as most earbud cases. There are three battery indicator lights on the front and a button for pairing around back. That may sound like a small detail, but I\u2019ve come to really appreciate earbuds that have a physical button for pairing. It\u2019s far easier to use than tapping the earbuds to pair like you have to on the Jabra Elite 85t.\nLike most earbuds, the Air 2 Pro have tap controls when you\u2019re wearing them: double-tap on the left bud to skip the next track, double-tap on the right for play and pause, or hold down for two seconds on either bud to toggle ambient sound modes. It\u2019s great that the buds respond quickly to my taps, but I\u2019m frustrated by how limited the controls are. All of them can be customized in the app, but I wish there was a single-tap or even triple-tap option. \nEither bud can be used independently of the other, and in-ear detection can be toggled on and off in Anker\u2019s app. Take an earbud out of your ear, and your music will stop; put the bud back in your ear, and it will resume. The in-ear detection was a bit sensitive for my liking. When I had a hood on, for example, every time the earbud was knocked by my hood, my music would pause even if the bud was still seated in my ear. A quick readjustment of the bud would get my music playing again but ultimately turned off the in-ear detection feature entirely.\nThe battery life is on par with other ANC earbuds. Anker claims seven hours of battery life with ANC turned off or six hours with it turned on. There are three additional charges in the case, which can be recharged wirelessly or via the USB-C port on the back. This was more than enough juice to get me to the point of my ears needing a break from the buds\u2019 tight, in-ear seal. There is also 15-minute fast charging that can get three hours of listening time when the case is plugged into an outlet via USB-C. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three battery indicator lights on the front of the case.\n\n\nThe Liberty Air 2 Pro support SBC and AAC audio codecs. They have 11mm drivers that create a more treble-heavy sound. While music felt full and immersive with crisp separation, I often wanted more bass. Lifting the lows in the app\u2019s EQ helped, but it wasn\u2019t as clean-sounding as the bass in the AirPods Pro. 1970s funk and soul sounded great, but more contemporary R&B felt a bit flat.\nI was most impressed with the active noise cancellation on the Liberty Air 2 Pro. Outside of Amazon\u2019s Echo Buds, there really aren\u2019t many options at this price that even include it, much less do it well.\nThe Air 2 Pro have three ambient sound modes: full noise cancellation, transparency mode, and normal. Within the full ANC and transparency modes, there are more specific controls for managing the levels of passthrough sound. You can enable a Transport mode for canceling low-end frequencies, such as train rumbles; Indoor mode for midrange frequencies; an Outdoor mode that Anker claims is best for city spaces; or build a custom mode for dialing in the best setting for you. I set my ANC to Transport and left it there for most of my time and found it comparable to the ANC in the Jabra Elite 85t, a set of earbuds that costs $100 more than Anker\u2019s.\nThe noise cancellation let the outside world fade away, but it wasn\u2019t as isolating as the AirPods Pro or Galaxy Buds Pro. And although the transparency mode is serviceable, it doesn\u2019t have the same earbud-less feel of the AirPods Pro either. There is a Vocal transparency mode that takes out lower frequencies while allowing higher frequencies, such as voices, through. It was helpful when listening for train announcements, but ultimately, taking an earbud out to hear an announcement was far easier.\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Soundcore app is is well-designed and easy to use.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe app contains many ambient sound controls that are fun to play with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgree to Continue: Anker Liberty Air 2 Pro\nEvery smart device now requires you to agree to a series of terms and conditions before you can use it \u2014 contracts that no one actually reads. It\u2019s impossible for us to read and analyze every single one of these agreements. But we started counting exactly how many times you have to hit \u201cagree\u201d to use devices when we review them since these are agreements most people don\u2019t read and definitely can\u2019t negotiate.\nYou can pair the Liberty Air 2 Pro to your phone over Bluetooth without agreeing to any terms of service. But if you want to use the Soundcore companion app, you\u2019ll have to agree to Anker\u2019s:\n\nTerms of service\nPrivacy policy\n\nIf you use the HearID function to customize the sound profile for your ears, you\u2019ll need to give the app permission to record audio on your phone.\nFinal tally: no mandatory agreements, two optional agreements, and one optional permission.\n\n\nMost apps for wireless earbuds are so bad that I open them once to set EQ settings and some custom touch controls, and that\u2019s it. The Soundcore app had me coming back to it time and time again, though, mostly to play with all of the different controls it offered. \nWhen I was bored on the train, I would open the app and start testing out all of the transparency modes while strangers spoke to each other across the car. I also had fun turning the EQ settings up and down. The app is filled with pleasing colors and is easy to navigate, which is surprisingly rare in the earbud market. \nIn a wireless earbud market full of worthy (and not so worthy) competition, it is increasingly hard to be impressed by a new pair of buds. But the competitive $130 price tag of the Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro brought me in, and their true active noise cancellation and well-designed app kept me coming back for more. They could certainly use a bit more bass and a smaller case, but Anker has made a pair of wireless earbuds that bridges the gap between a more budget-friendly option and a reliable, all-around great earbud that I was excited to put into my ears every day.\nPhotography by Becca Farsace \/ The Verge","Author":"Becca Farsace"},{"Date":"Mar 10, 2021,  7:48pm EST","Title":"GameStop\u2019s stock was on the rise again, until it wasn\u2019t","Article":"GameStop stock (GME) soared in value on Wednesday, peaking at $348.50 per share.

By that time, Tesla\u2019s Cybertruck, the electric Hummer pickup, Ford\u2019s electric F-150, and Rivian\u2019s EV pickup should all be on the road. Canoo said it will start taking preorders for its pickup later this year, but did not release pricing details. The startup is also reportedly in talks with other states for a \u201cmicrofactory\u201d where a contract manufacturer would build the vehicles. \nThe toyish truck shows just how far Canoo is willing to push the design of the microbus-style vehicle it first debuted back in 2019, which it originally planned to sell on a subscription-only basis. \nCanoo has undergone a lot of changes since it debuted that first vehicle, though. It\u2019s now a publicly-traded company after it merged with a special purpose acquisition company in late 2020. Its new executive chairman has also refocused the company on selling commercial vehicles based on the original van design and the technological platform that powers it. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nCanoo unveils a new electric delivery vehicle ahead of stock exchange debut\n\nBut all of that doesn\u2019t mean Canoo is exactly done trying to make vehicles for regular consumers. This new truck sort of bridges the two sets of customers, thanks in part to being loaded up with all sorts of utility features. \n\n\n\n\n\n Grid View\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are multiple fold-down and flip-out work surfaces on Canoo\u2019s pickup, with one in the nose of the vehicle and another on the side of the truck bed. There\u2019s an extension that can be pulled out to make the bed a few feet longer. There are power outlets (120V and USB) dotting the inside of the bed and the storage compartments. Promo images also show the truck decked out in a roof rack and, in a bid to capitalize on the booming \u201cvan life\u201d market, an \u201coverlander\u201d trim with a camper shell and a pop-up tent. \nThis is all in keeping with the vision of Canoo\u2019s original vehicle, which was decked out in pegboards on the inside that the company imagined people could use to customize and personalize the vehicle. And the ability to use the new truck\u2019s modular features in so many different ways \u2014 and to customize them from the start when ordering \u2014 is what Tony Aquila, the startup\u2019s new executive chairman, hopes is a big selling point for the small businesses and more adventurous consumers that Canoo is targeting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \u201coverlander\u201d version of Canoo\u2019s new pickup truck.\n\n\n\u201cWhen the working person sees this they go, \u2018I can have a better quality of life with this vehicle, and I can get a return on capital.\u2019 And every one of these areas is a space to create a return on capital, which is why we spent so much money to develop the most intelligent [truck] bed,\u201d Aquila said in a video announcing the truck. (Canoo spent $47 million on research and development in 2018, $137 million in 2019, and $52 million through the first three quarters of 2020, according to a recent government filing.)\nThe sloped roof of the truck also tracks with Canoo\u2019s original vehicle, though it\u2019s a far more familiar design feature for a van. Fortunately for Canoo, Tesla has already started stretching the public\u2019s imagination of what a pickup truck can look like.\n\u201cThis is for America.\u201d\n\u201cThat was our dream, to make sure that we had a vehicle that brought a truck to the market that just really shocked people just from the visual, and then to the functional,\u201d Aquila said in the video. \u201cThis is for America. This is what built America, anyways.\u201d \nCanoo\u2019s truck will be built on the same platform that powers the company\u2019s other proposed vehicles, which means it largely shares the same specs across a number of configurations. The highest-cost all-wheel-drive truck will have around 600 horsepower and more than 200 miles of range, while the lower cost versions will get closer to 100 miles of range and feature a single motor in the rear. (Aquila told Reuters he thinks Canoo can find a way to up the range to 300 miles by the time it\u2019s released.) The truck also uses the same brake-by-wire and steer-by-wire system Canoo developed for its other vehicles, which reduces complexity. \nThese technologies have made it possible for the startup to mate so many different designs to the same underlying technological platform. They\u2019re also things that drew the interest of Apple, which at one point wanted to acquire Canoo, as The Verge exclusively reported earlier this year. \nUpdate March 10th, 9:58PM ET: Added details from the Reuters report.","Author":"Sean O'Kane"},{"Date":"Mar 10, 2021,  8:35pm EST","Title":"Verizon decrees only \u2018premium\u2019 customers can escape its slowest 5G speeds","Article":"If you\u2019re on a basic Verizon plan, you\u2019re going to be stuck with the company\u2019s poor performing \u201cnationwide\u201d 5G network \u2014 even after critical C-band spectrum comes online. The company revealed in a presentation to investors and confirmed to The Verge that C-band frequencies, and their faster speeds, will only be available to customers on \u201cpremium\u201d unlimited plans. Those on metered or the basic Start Unlimited plan will be relegated to slower, low-band 5G.\n\n\nVerizon confirms that to access C-Band you will need a premium unlimited plan like its Play More, Do More and Get More. If you have an older plan you'll only have access to its DSS \"nationwide\" 5G, not this newer and faster flavor.  https:\/\/t.co\/JH1uTixZaI\u2014 Eli Blumenthal (@eliblumenthal) March 10, 2021\n\n\n\nThis is essentially how the company already treats its ultra-fast mmWave 5G: customers on the base-level unlimited plan don\u2019t have access to this network, while Play More, Do More, and Get More Unlimited subscribers do. Customers on metered plans don\u2019t have mmWave access either, and likewise won\u2019t have C-band, though they can add access to both for an additional fee.\nThe company is extremely keen to funnel customers into \u201cstep up\u201d plans and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive\nThat\u2019s bad news for Verizon customers hoping that C-band would improve the poor performance they\u2019re seeing on the company\u2019s nationwide 5G. The network currently uses narrow low-band channels not well suited for 5G, and relies on a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing to accommodate 4G and 5G traffic on the same frequencies. As a result, Verizon\u2019s 5G speeds are closer to 4G \u2014 and at times even slower. \nVerizon has been limited by the spectrum it has access to, and so it spent big in the recent FCC auction of mid-band frequencies known as C-band. This chunk of spectrum is ideal for 5G, offering faster speeds than LTE with coverage that\u2019s broader than range-limited mmWave. The company bid $45.4 billion on C-band licenses \u2014 more than double what AT&T spent. When these blocks of frequencies start becoming available at the end of the year, it should significantly boost the network\u2019s performance.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerizon predicts premium unlimited plans will make up 50% of its postpaid account mix by the end of 2023.\n\n\n\nAnd that $45 billion is just the start. Verizon revealed on its investor presentation that it plans to spend an additional $10 billion over the next three years on C-band deployment, above and beyond its expected capital expenditure. That\u2019s likely why the company is extremely keen to funnel customers into \u201cstep up\u201d plans, and is using that C-band spectrum as incentive.\nVerizon also says that going forward, all new phones that it sells will be C-band compatible. That\u2019s already the case for flagships like the Galaxy S21 and iPhone 12 series, but not all budget or midrange phone are C-band compatible in the US. That\u2019s one less thing for phone shoppers to have to think about when buying a phone with Verizon, but it also makes Verizon\u2019s job of talking you into a more expensive plan easier, too. And if you\u2019re on one of their basic plans, you might be hearing that sales pitch sooner than later.","Author":"Allison Johnson"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 11:15am EST","Title":"The engineers building ridiculous dart blasters that Nerf won\u2019t touch","Article":"It was a beautiful summer day in San Jose, California, perfect for pegging people with foam. My brother was particularly proud: he\u2019d already been getting some great tags with his Nerf revolver, and now some guy had sold him a nifty 3D-printed cylinder so it could hold seven darts instead of five. I wanted one, too.\nIt turned out the guy who sold him the cylinder, Luke, was mostly just there to say his goodbyes to the local Nerf group, before leaving the Bay Area for good. I didn\u2019t think much of it at the time. I certainly didn\u2019t know Luke Goodman was about to quit his day job to become the foam-slinging equivalent of James Bond\u2019s gadget armorer Q.\nLuke, better known as Out of Darts, went viral in 2015 when he figured out how to turn Nerf\u2019s 12-round Zeus blaster into a 108-round ball-blasting contraption a little more worthy of the Greek god\u2019s name. As many as 15 million people have watched PDK Films blow away an entire wall of Solo cups with Luke\u2019s creation, after it got featured at Gizmodo and by popular Nerf YouTube star Drac (aka LordDraconical). \nHe wasn\u2019t yet out to build a better Nerf blaster; Luke was simply doing some irrigation work in his backyard when he realized the pipe he was holding might fit inside the Zeus. \u201cI put a piece of it in there, pulled the trigger and just cackled,\u201d he tells me. When he saw the YouTube numbers, he couldn\u2019t believe his eyes. Then the emails started pouring in. Hundreds of people had tracked him down, asking to buy his \u201cHIRricane\u201d blaster. He whipped up a quick Etsy shop and got to work. But even at $160 per kit or $325 for an assembled blaster \u2014 an \u201cabsurd price\u201d he set to see if it was worth his time \u2014 he still couldn\u2019t keep up with the demand. \n\nNow, Out of Darts is at the forefront of a cottage industry selling original blasters and parts that can leave the official Nerf brand (owned by Transformers, G.I. Joe, and Magic: The Gathering giant Hasbro) in the dust. It\u2019s almost something of an arms race, where the Nerf internet community one-ups each other by making their toy blasters shoot more foam faster, farther, and more accurately, whether to show off or to perform that much better in an actual game of Nerf. And while Hasbro is clearly taking some notes from the upstart maker community, 3D printers in particular are giving makers an edge they\u2019ve never had before. \nOriginally, Luke took the cottage industry part literally, selling blasters and parts out of his own house with just a few 3D printers to start. But today, he\u2019s the proud proprietor of a 3,800-square-foot warehouse with eight employees, running a 97-printer factory that consumes over 300 pounds of filament each month. They ship nearly 100 orders a day to an army of hobbyists eager to build epic blasters of their own, customers who can now select from 1,500 different products including individual batteries, motors, and original 3D-printed parts. It\u2019s gotten to the point that they needed to build a custom inventory picking program just to keep it all organized and let workers box up multiple orders at once.\nHe now makes more money than he ever did behind the camera; enough to pay his shop employees an average of $20 an hour, too. He\u2019s the first person I\u2019d heard of to make a comfortable living from the Nerf cottage industry. But he\u2019s far from the only one reshaping what a Nerf blaster can be.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Little Rocket blaster with modular barrels.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwenty-four colors of filament are stacked and ready to use in the 3D printers at Out of Darts. They go through over 300 pounds a month.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlaster barrels produced in-house with 3D printers are organized by size and color at the Out of Darts warehouse and factory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA 3D printer produces original parts at Out of Darts. Out of Darts runs 97 3D printers to produce their original blasters and modification parts.\n\n\n\nIn the \u201990s, Nerf was a simple game of tag you could play at a distance with your siblings, friends, maybe the neighbor kid down the street. You\u2019d be lucky if you could afford a blaster that could shoot a single dart more than 50 feet, and that was only if you fired up at an angle praying it would land on target. There\u2019s a reason the word \u201cnerfing\u201d means to weaken something \u2014 Nerf blasters were supposed to be safe for kids \u2014 but kids got wise. They\u2019d cut off the tip of an arrow-firing blaster to make it shoot darts, plug safety holes with hot glue, and add rubber bands or bungies to make them shoot farther. Modding was part of the excitement of Nerf; you could bring anything you liked to the park as long as it wouldn\u2019t put someone\u2019s eye out.\nAround the world, hotspots began to form \u2014 groups of Nerfers who pooled their knowledge and resources to host giant Nerf wars that could last days at a time. The internet brought them online, and the sophistication level of modders crept up from trial and error to actual science, discussing the optimal winding of an electric motor, the length of a barrel. Engineers who used to fling a few darts as children have realized there\u2019s now an entire online community waiting for them to demonstrate what they can make foam projectiles do. \nSteven Lawver was one of those kids who returned to the hobby as a science pro. Known as Captain Slug, he\u2019s a modder who has, arguably, single-handedly transformed the Nerf scene twice: once in 2007 with his \u201cPlusbow,\u201d a DIY re-creation of Nerf\u2019s legendary 1995 Crossbow (once considered one of the most powerful blasters in the sport), and more recently in 2016 with the Caliburn, a 3D-printed marvel. \nProperly tuned, the Caliburn was one of the first magazine-fed blasters that could reliably and repeatedly hit things at a distance, with a beefy 11-inch spring and a robust pump-action mechanism. It used to be you could simply run toward your foes in Nerf, dodging darts on the way; the first few times I faced off against a Caliburn, I got pegged in the head and torso multiple times before I even got within range. \nBut perhaps the real genius of the Caliburn was that Slug gave the files away for free, letting anyone print and remix the open-source plastic pieces themselves. He\u2019ll build you a turnkey blaster if you\u2019ve got the cash, sure, but he primarily sells packs of the metal hardware to folks who enjoy the mild challenge of assembling one at home. I certainly did:\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA traditional full-length Caliburn blaster, designed by Captain Slug.\nPhoto by Sean Hollister \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI bought the metal parts from Slug\u2019s online shop, but a friend printed the plastic ones locally.\nPhoto by Sean Hollister \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n\nNo readymade blaster ever offered that kind of performance until Slug showed the way. Now, they\u2019re set to become a mainstay of sporting-grade Nerf, with companies like Jet Blaster and Dart Zone selling powerful, accurate rifle-shaped blasters for as little as $50 at Walmart. He\u2019s even licensed his blaster designs to other shops; Worker, a quality Chinese aftermarket Nerf parts brand that increasingly sells blasters as well, cut a deal to mass-produce a \u201cWorker Caliburn.\u201d You can\u2019t go to a modern Nerf war without seeing at least a handful of Caliburns, and forks off of the idea.\nThere have been strong signs that Hasbro is paying attention and might want a piece of the action. In 2015, it launched Rival, a line of blasters targeting older players, advertising \u201chigh-impact rounds\u201d that would travel at \u201c70 miles per hour.\u201d After Luke\u2019s 108-round \u201cHIRricane\u201d went viral, Hasbro released two $100-and-up blasters with 100-plus round capacities, too. But the official Nerf brand has yet to release anything anywhere near as powerful and accurate as Captain Slug\u2019s Caliburn.\nLast month, Slug decided to quit his day job, too. He tells me he was already spending nearly as much time on his expanding array of designs as he did working at a material science lab, but blasters have become the bigger breadwinner by far: after producing over 1,500 Caliburn kits, 4,500 metal hardware sets and inking eight licensing deals over the past few years, he now makes over $100,000 a year from custom Nerf blasters alone. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Out of Darts Jupiter blaster. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Out of Darts is nearly ready to bring a long-awaited invention to the world. It\u2019s a next-gen version of the blaster that brought Luke his original 15 minutes of fame: the Out of Darts Rival Jupiter \u2014 designed in large part by his friend Tarik Crnovrsanin \u2014 and its companion Proton Pack, a device that can continually feed an incredible amount of ammo to a blaster through its swiveling tube. \nEven by itself, the $99 Jupiter is an impressive sidearm, able to unleash a 12-ball blitz so fast foes don\u2019t know what hit them. (That\u2019s also partly because it\u2019s so small.) I took it to a Nerf war before the pandemic hit, and I could tag out entire groups of foes at close range so long as I was willing to sacrifice myself \u2014 or lucky enough to find some cover for a rapid reload. But with the Proton Pack, it can live up to its Ghostbusters namesake: a nonstop stream of balls, only limited by the size of the ammo drum you\u2019re willing to haul around. \nI cram the entry-level 430-round hopper into my backpack, fill it to the brim with foam spheres, and seal it tight so the pressure from its brushless blower fan (and jam-busting auger) can feed them into the tube. And then, yes, I cackle too \u2014 as every single one of those 430 balls blast across my backyard from a veritable firehose I can hold in a single hand. Which in turn invites an obvious question: why not wield two? \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLuke Goodman with the Out of Darts Proton Pack and Jupiter, which can fire 20 rounds a second. He says he\u2019s blasted tens of thousands of rounds through the system without jamming.\n\n\n\nThe answer might be the price: when Luke\u2019s Proton Pack finally goes on sale later today (after teasing his customers for years), it\u2019ll cost $165 for the DIY kit alone, not including a blaster or battery. If you want to pair it with a Jupiter, that\u2019ll be an additional $99, though you\u2019ll also be able to buy an adapter for some of the most popular blasters Hasbro sells \u2014 including the Perses, Zeus, Khaos, and Hera \u2014 just so long as you\u2019ve got the basic soldering skills to rewire them. One financial consolation prize is you\u2019ll only need one battery to power both: the Proton Pack doubles as a power source for your blaster, even sensing the current draw from your flywheels before it spins up its own motors to feed balls through the flexible swiveling tube.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat the Jupiter and Proton Pack can do.\n\n\n\nOverpowered? Perhaps, but that\u2019s the state of the Nerf hobby in 2021, where I see incredible original blasters appear at the r\/Nerf and r\/NerfHomemades subreddits on what feels like a weekly basis these days. The wide availability of 3D printers, powerful miniature motors, and high-power LiPo batteries has transformed the hobby over the past few years, to the point that seemingly unbeatable blasters are foiled by new inventions before long. \u201cThe first two games I just hammered people,\u201d says Luke of his early Proton Pack prototypes, but his advantage didn\u2019t last. \u201cTwo or three games later, everyone had Caliburns, and I\u2019d get [tagged] before I stepped out from behind the tree.\u201d\nIt\u2019s the next expansion that might be Out of Darts\u2019 most ambitious yet. Though he hasn\u2019t been able to visit China for over a year, Luke managed to find a genuine factory to start mass-producing his original products with actual injection-molded plastic. He\u2019s starting small with a new dart magazine for existing blasters, but says that it might make more sense to invest in tooling than 3D printing for anything they\u2019re likely to sell a few thousand of \u2014 for instance, their popular Rival Perses hopper, which expands the 50-round capacity of Nerf\u2019s fastest blaster to 160 rounds while making it far, far easier to reload. (It also helps that it\u2019s a large, difficult part to 3D print, but comparatively easy to mold.)\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Nerf Rival Perses, with Out of Darts\u2019 3D-printed hopper. \n\n\n\nLuke admits that it\u2019s a nerve-wracking experience, waiting to find out if the first production run from a factory he\u2019s never actually managed to visit will be good enough \u2014 each set of tooling can cost tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cThat\u2019s why we hadn\u2019t gotten into it yet; I wasn\u2019t going to risk my whole business on a design,\u201d he tells me.\nThe not-so-dirty, not-so-secret dirty little secret of the Nerf cottage industry is that 3D-printed plastic isn\u2019t very profitable, so injection molding is one way forward. Otherwise, metal\u2019s where the money\u2019s at; threaded rods, screws, and springs are the bulk of Slug\u2019s business, and one-fifth of Out of Darts\u2019 sales come from motors alone. With few exceptions, you could buy them from anywhere.\nBut each business has amazing goodwill in the community, and it\u2019s not hard to see why: they show up, time and again, with something new and exciting to contribute. Speak CaptainSlug\u2019s name on Reddit, and he\u2019ll often magically appear \u2014 sometimes to share progress on a brand-new design, sometimes just to shoot the shit or comment on your build. Another community example: FoamBlast, a rival parts business that also collaborates with Out of Darts, hosts a weekly Nerf news show.\nWhen Luke\u2019s not running the shop or answering customer email, he also spends much of his time on YouTube, filming remarkably high-quality video reviews and mod guides for Nerf\u2019s latest blasters, often with parts he created specifically to make modding more accessible. \nIn January 2019, I decided to try a high-power rapid-fire blaster mod with his custom parts instead of fiddling with hot glue, and was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was. For under $25, I bought some excellent hobby wire, a couple high-amperage Omron switches, and four 3D printed parts designed to perfectly mate those switches with a Nerf blaster\u2019s triggers. A few hours later, guided by this step-by-step Out of Darts video, I\u2019d turned my Nerf Rival Nemesis, already one of Hasbro\u2019s more powerful designs, into a beast kicking out 9 balls a second.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarik Crnovrsanin (at right) holds two of his designs: a Proud Papa mounted atop a Jupiter. He\u2019s a data scientist who also built the website and picker software for Out of Darts.\n\n\n\nAnd last November, Out of Darts collaborator Tarik surprised me with the accessory I\u2019ve been secretly begging Nerf to make for years: a bolt-on blaster for your blaster, so you can shoot while you reload. He calls his $20 Little Rocket \/ $22 mountable Proud Papa the world\u2019s smallest 3D-printed blaster, but it also packs quite a punch, firing standard Nerf darts with more power than many of Nerf\u2019s own blasters at a fraction of the size. Better still, it\u2019s got modular twist \u2019n\u2019 lock barrels to quickly swap out a single long-range dart for a three-round spread or a shield-busting Mega. (Shields are a thing in some Nerf games, and the big red Mega darts are traditionally what you need to take them out of commission.) \nIt\u2019s exactly the kind of product that Out of Darts wants to be known for, Luke says: something the community wants, and that nobody had thought to create and sell quite yet. \n\nThese days, Luke tells me, he buys every single blaster from every brand as soon as he possibly can, to test it, figure out whether it\u2019s going to be popular, and \u2014 if so \u2014 where he sees room for improvements he can make and sell. That\u2019s where the easy-to-reload Perses hopper idea came from, and more recently, a mod for that powerful $50 Walmart blaster, the 125-feet-per-second Dart Zone Nexus Pro. \u201cWe have games that don\u2019t allow blasters to shoot that hard, and some where we\u2019d like to shoot harder,\u201d says Luke, who started selling an incredibly elegant solution in no time flat: a \u201ctuning cap\u201d you can install in seconds to reduce or increase compression on the spring that powers your blaster. \n\u201cIt was probably two or three weeks from the second I got the blaster to us having a product out,\u201d says Luke, who credits the low prototyping costs of 3D printing with the fast turnaround. It wouldn\u2019t have been possible with injection molding alone. \nThere are risks to building your entire livelihood on a hobby predominantly controlled by a single company, of course. Nerf brand owner Hasbro discourages modding as a general rule, and when its entire 2020 lineup of \u201cElite 2.0\u201d blasters turned out to be a cut-rate selection of poor performers that were hard for modders to open, he wound up with nothing to sell. \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNinety-seven 3D printers produce modification parts and complete blasters at Out of Darts.\n\n\n\nA few days after we spoke, Hasbro revealed its biggest Nerf news in years \u2014 a successor to Rival that seems likely to replace it entirely, and, I imagine, make some of Luke\u2019s planned products obsolete. I hopped back on the phone with Luke, to ask him what he\u2019ll do. To my surprise, he didn\u2019t seem even a little bit worried. If anything, he seemed giddy \u2014 already full of ideas for the new Hyper lineup. \nSure, he probably won\u2019t make any more hoppers for the discontinued Perses, but he thinks a hopper might fit perfectly atop the similar Mach-100... should the community embrace the smaller (and likely easier to lose) Hyper ammo, of course. He thinks there\u2019s more than enough Rival blasters already out in the world to sell the 1,000 Proton Packs he\u2019s building, too. They\u2019re out of Hasbro\u2019s hands now.\nIt makes me think back to the last big Nerf war I attended, where I saw more than a handful of Nerfers go into battle without a single scrap of actual Nerf-branded gear. The community has its own magazines, its own ammo, and is now regularly building blasters more powerful than anything Hasbro has ever put on shelves. \u201cIt\u2019s Nerf or nothing\u201d hasn\u2019t been true for a while.\nWhen I ask Luke what does keep him up at night, he says there isn\u2019t much; perhaps just that he\u2019s got seven employees whose livelihoods now depend on his business, too. There was a moment at the beginning of the pandemic where it seemed like everything would fall apart, the shop would be forced to close, and that would have been the end; he would have had to go back to shooting weddings and tech company videos. Instead, he closed for a couple days, switched most of the printers over to medical face shields for a few weeks, and that was it. The orders kept coming in.","Author":"Sean Hollister"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  7:15am EST","Title":"Oppo announces Find X3 Pro flagship with microscope camera","Article":"After a drawn-out series of leaks and teases, Oppo has announced its 2021 flagship in full. The Find X3 Pro is a sleek, powerful phone with an unusual design and some unique features to match. It\u2019s also an important device for Oppo, which recently overtook Huawei in the Chinese smartphone market and will be looking to capitalize on its rival\u2019s troubles this year.\nThe Find X3 Pro\u2019s most arresting visual element is its camera bump, which almost looks organic in the way it seamlessly rises from the same piece of glass as the rest of the phone\u2019s back panel. Combined with the finish, which on my unit is aggressively shiny and glossy, the phone looks sort of like it was forged out of Terminator 2-style liquid metal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe camera system itself is no less unusual. There\u2019s a primary camera and an ultrawide that both use 50-megapixel 1\/1.56-inch Sony IMX766 sensors, meaning the image quality should be comparable across both, though we\u2019ll have to see how that bears out in practice.\nThere\u2019s also a 3-megapixel microlens, which shouldn\u2019t be mistaken for the useless macro cameras found in some phones today. Oppo claims up to 60x magnification, and it\u2019s more like a microscope than a macro lens \u2014 you can take pictures of things like subpixel layouts on screens, and there\u2019s even a ring light to illuminate the subject. I\u2019m not sure if this will be a selling point for many people, but in my early testing I can confirm that it\u2019s pretty cool. Here\u2019s a quick shot of my computer monitor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that the whole shot isn\u2019t quite in focus, and that\u2019s because depth of field is extremely shallow when shooting this close \u2014 you have to get within millimeters. I probably need more practice using the microlens, but my first impression is that it might be more useful for looking at things in real time than capturing them for sharing.\nOne notable omission is a periscope zoom lens, even though Oppo did more than anyone to popularize the technology. There is a telephoto lens here, but it\u2019s just a 13-megapixel sensor with 2x optical zoom over the primary camera. That\u2019s not necessarily a downgrade, since it could improve image quality at mid-range shooting distances, but it does mean the Find X3 Pro won\u2019t have anywhere near as much zoom reach as its 5x-telephoto-equipped predecessor.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Find X3 Pro\u2019s display is another key feature; it\u2019s a 3216 x 1440 LTPO OLED panel with a peak brightness of 1,300 nits and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. Oppo is making a big deal out of the fact that it\u2019s a 10-bit panel and that it\u2019s integrated full-path color management into ColorOS; this means photos and videos captured with the cameras can be displayed with more than a billion colors, as opposed to the 16.7 million colors on conventional smartphone screens.\nThe Find X3 Pro has typically flagship-tier internals: a Snapdragon 888 processor, 12GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. The 4,500mAh battery can be fast-charged at up to 65W, and Oppo has finally embraced wireless charging on a flagship with a 30W system that can fully charge the phone in 80 minutes. The lack of wireless charging was my biggest knock against the Find X2 Pro, so Oppo\u2019s off to a good start here.\nWe don\u2019t have pricing or release details for the Find X3 Pro just yet; Oppo plans to announce that next week. Stay tuned for more information and a full review.","Author":"Sam Byford"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  4:52am EST","Title":"Relax with the calming sound of NASA\u2019s Perseverance firing lasers on Mars","Article":"NASA has released an audio recording of its Perseverance rover firing lasers on the martian surface. The strikes, which sound like a series of small clicks, are designed to help scientists analyze the rocks around the rover. In this case the target was a rock called \u201cM\u00e1az,\u201d which scientists were able to discover was basaltic, BBC News reports, meaning it contains a lot of magnesium and iron.\nAccording to NASA\u2019s site, the laser is fired by Perseverance\u2019s \u201cSuperCam,\u201d and allows the rover to \u201czap and study areas on a rock as small as the period at the end of this sentence\u201d from a distance of 20 feet (7 meters) away. Once the laser has fired at a rock, it uses its camera and spectrometer to analyze the hot gas the rock is vaporized into. The sound the laser creates offers additional data on the rock being studied.\n\n\n  You\u2019re listening to the first audio recordings of laser strikes on Mars. These rhythmic tapping sounds heard by the microphone on my SuperCam instrument have different intensities that can help my team figure out the structure of the rocks around me. https:\/\/t.co\/nfWyOyfhNy\u2014 NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) March 10, 2021\n\n\n\nSince its successful landing last month, Perseverance has sent back a variety of images and audio recordings from the surface of Mars.

The group, who call themselves Advanced Persistent Threat 69420, stumbled across log-in credentials for Verkada\u2019s \u201cSuper Admin\u201d accounts online. They publicized their findings, saying they were motivated by \u201clots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism \u2014 and it\u2019s also just too much fun not to do it.\u201d\nSuper Admin accounts gave hackers and employees access to tens of thousands of feeds\nNow, anonymous Verkada employees say the same \u201cSuper Admin\u201d accounts that the hackers accessed were also widely shared in the company itself. More than 100 employees had Super Admin privileges, reports Bloomberg, meaning that these individuals could browse the live feeds from tens of thousands of cameras around the world at any time. \u201cWe literally had 20-year-old interns that had access to over 100,000 cameras and could view all of their feeds globally,\u201d one former senior-level employee told the publication. \nVerkada, meanwhile, says access was limited to employees who needed to fix technical problems or address user complaints. \u201cVerkada\u2019s training program and policies for employees are both clear that support staff members were and are required to secure a customer\u2019s explicit permission before accessing that customer\u2019s video feed,\u201d said the Silicon Valley firm in a statement given to Bloomberg. \nThe Washington Post, though, cites the testimony of surveillance researcher Charles Rollet, who says individuals with close knowledge of the company told him that Verkada employees could access feeds without customers\u2019 knowledge. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize what happens on the back-end, and they assume that there are always these super-formal processes when it comes to accessing footage, and that the company will always need to give explicit consent,\u201d said Rollet. But clearly that\u2019s not always the case.\u201d\nAnother former employee told Bloomberg that although Verkada\u2019s internal systems asked workers to explain why they were accessing a customer\u2019s camera, this documentation was not taken seriously. \u201cNobody cared about checking the logs,\u201d said the employee. \u201cYou could put whatever you wanted in that note; you could even just enter a single space.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVerkada\u2019s cameras offer AI-powered analytics, including facial recognition and the ability to search footage for specific individuals.\nImage: Verkada\n\n\nVerkada\u2019s cloud-based cameras were sold to customers in part on the strength of their analytical software. One feature called \u201cPeople Analytics\u201d let customers \u201csearch and filter based on many different attributes, including gender traits, clothing color, and even a person\u2019s face,\u201d said Verkada in a blog post.

The sale positions him \u201camong the top three most valuable living artists,\u201d according to the auction house.\nThe record-smashing NFT sale comes after months of increasingly valuable auctions. In October, Winkelmann sold his first series of NFTs, with a pair going for $66,666.66 each. In December, he sold a series of works for $3.5 million total. And last month, one of the NFTs that originally sold for $66,666.66 was resold for $6.6 million.\n\u201cI do view this as the next chapter of art history.\u201d\nNFTs, or non-fungible tokens, are unique files that live on a blockchain and are able to verify ownership of a work of digital art. Buyers typically get limited rights to display the digital artwork they represent, but in many ways, they\u2019re just buying bragging rights and an asset they may be able to resell later. The technology has absolutely exploded over the past few weeks \u2014 and Winkelmann, more than anyone else, has been at the forefront of its rapid rise.\n\u201cHe showed us this collage, and that was my eureka moment when I knew this was going to be extremely important,\u201d Noah Davis, a specialist in post-war and contemporary art at Christie\u2019s, told The Verge. \u201cIt was just so monumental and so indicative of what NFTs can do.\u201d\n\n\nChristie's is proud to offer \"Everydays - The First 5000 Days\" by @beeple as the first purely digital work of art ever offered by a major auction house.

For one, he\u2019s developed a large fan base, with around 2.5 million followers across social channels. And he\u2019s famously prolific: as part of a project called \u201cEverydays,\u201d Winkelmann creates and publishes a new digital artwork every day. The project is now in its 14th year.\n\nAt the same time, NFTs have blown up over the past month and \u2014 for the moment, at least \u2014 are being seen by many as the way digital art will be acquired and traded going forward. For collectors who believe that\u2019s true, the escalating prices are nothing compared to what NFTs will be worth down the road, when the rest of the world has caught onto their value.\nChristie\u2019s is also a legitimizing force for both Winkelmann\u2019s art and NFTs as a technology. The 255-year-old auction house has sold some of the most famous paintings in history, from the only known portrait of Shakespeare created during his lifetime to the last-discovered painting by Leonardo da Vinci.\n\n\nWhat\u2019s an NFT?\nNFTs allow you to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items and keep track of who owns them using the blockchain. NFT stands for \u201cnon-fungible token,\u201d and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games. An NFT can either be one-of-a-kind, like a real-life painting, or one copy of many, like trading cards, but the blockchain keeps track of who has ownership of the file.\nNFTs have been making headlines lately, some selling for millions of dollars, with high-profile memes like Nyan Cat and the \u201cdeal with it\u201d sunglasses being put up for auction. There\u2019s also a lot of discussion about the massive electricity use and\u00a0environmental impacts\u00a0of NFTs.\u00a0If you (understandably) still have questions, you can read through our NFT FAQ.\n\n\nCombine that with Winkelmann already being at the forefront of NFT sales, and today\u2019s auction was destined to set records.\n\u201cI do view this as the next chapter of art history,\u201d Winkelmann said. \u201cNow there is a way to collect digital art.\u201d\nThe piece that was sold, Everydays: The First 5000 Days, is a collage of Winkelmann\u2019s work starting at the beginning of the project, when he was posting somewhat crude sketches. It runs through years of evolving digital shapes and sceneries up through the beginning of this year, when he was posting extremely crude political illustrations.\nThe auction\u2019s winner doesn\u2019t get much: a digital file, mostly, plus some vague rights to present the image. But Winkelmann expects to work with the buyer to find various ways to display the piece physically, whether that\u2019s on a TV in their house or projected onto \u201cthe side of a fucking building\u201d at Art Basel.\nThere\u2019s already been pushback against the rise of NFTs. Plenty of works of questionable artistic value are being sold at hype-driven auctions. Artists\u2019 works have allegedly been stolen and auctioned off as authentic. And many artists are concerned about the climate impact of art sales that rely on blockchain technology, which is notoriously inefficient by design. (Winkelmann said he plans to buy carbon offset for all his NFTs going forward so that their impact is a net positive.)\n\n\nCROSSROADBy @beeple The #1\/1 from beeple's first NG drop has just resold on the secondary market for $6.6 million.

Through the new deal, Axon will become the exclusive provider of Skydio\u2019s drones (like the Skydio 2 and X2) to law enforcement and police agencies, while Skydio will be able to offer Axon\u2019s drone-based software tools, like Axon Evidence and Axon Respond on its drones.\nBoth tools are largely observational in nature, so they wouldn\u2019t be turning the drones into weapons. Axon Evidence is used to compile footage, similar to how Axon\u2019s existing body cameras work, so that the drones can offer additional perspectives on a situation. Axon itself explicitly announced in 2019 that it won\u2019t be \u201ccommercializing face matching products.\u201d Similarly, Skydio\u2019s CEO has previously told The Verge that it won\u2019t be weaponizing its products.\nSkydio itself already sells drones to police departments, too \u2014 the Chula Vista, California police department is already a customer, for example, complete with limited FAA approval to use those drones beyond visual line of sight in emergency situations. But the Axon deal opens the door to make it much easier for departments to buy Skydio\u2019s products in the future. \n\n\n    Related\n  \nAutonomous drone maker Skydio shifts to military and enterprise with its first folding drone\n\nThe Skydio deal isn\u2019t Axon\u2019s first drone partnership; back in 2018, it launched its \u201cAxon Air\u201d program in partnership with DJI, offering Axon software on DJI drones sold directly by Axon. Axon says that it\u2019ll still be continuing its partnership with DJI, too, telling The Verge that \u201cthat no single drone platform covers every use case faced by public safety,\u201d and that having a US-based company like Skydio \u201chas greater potential to unlock opportunities in the federal market.\u201d\nDJI\u2019s Chinese ties have effectively sidelined it from US government work. DJI is headquartered in Shenzhen and its drones are largely made in China with Chinese parts, leading some officials to worry that DJI drones could be vulnerable to a supply chain attack by the Chinese government. The Department of the Interior grounded its DJI fleet in October 2019 over security concerns from spying or cyberattacks. The Department of Justice banned the purchase of foreign-made drones with agency funds last October. The Department of Defense\u2019s list of approved drones only includes products from Skydio, Parrot, and Vantage, with DJI notably absent from the list. \nDJI was also recently added to the US Department of Commerce\u2019s Entity List, which aimed to sanction DJI for enabling \u201cwide-scale human rights abuses within China,\u201d when the company provided drones to the Chinese government to surveil detention camps in the Xinjiang province. \nAnd while DJI is still able to sell its drones in the US to consumers, Skydio in particular has already managed to capitalize on the government\u2019s blacklist of Chinese drone companies, and it recently became the first US drone company to reach a $1 billion valuation. \nSkydio CEO Adam Bry told The Verge last year that it still intends to stay in the consumer drone business and that it won\u2019t be arming its drones. \u201cWe have more products coming in that market that we\u2019re excited about,\u201d said Bry. \nBut government and military deals are unquestionably a big part of Skydio\u2019s plans. Last year, the company debuted the Skydio X2 (an exclusively military and enterprise-focused drone that will be one of the models sold by Axon). Skydio also already has existing deals with the Air Force and DEA and is undergoing assessment by the US Army to be part of the Short Range Reconnaissance Program.\nUpdate March 11th, 11:45am: Added additional details on Skydio\u2019s existing police customers. \nUpdate March 11th, 5:20pm: Added information on Axon regarding its current DJI partnership.","Author":"Chaim Gartenberg"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 10:32am EST","Title":"How Facebook could escape the FTC\u2019s antitrust lawsuit","Article":"I.\nIn December, the Federal Trade Commission voted 3-2 to sue Facebook for illegally maintaining a monopoly in social networking. The lawsuit, which was accompanied by a separate suit joined by 49 US attorneys general, alleges that Facebook used acquisitions and software restrictions on developers to prevent competitors from succeeding.\nThe government\u2019s case appeared shaky from the start, I wrote at the time. Its allegation that Facebook owns a monopoly in advertising-supported social networking felt overly narrow and blinkered; the case does not even mention the existence of TikTok. And its suggestion that Facebook should have done more to share data with third-party developers seemingly runs counter to the FTC\u2019s own privacy enforcement actions \u2014 in 2019 the agency fined Facebook $5 billion for sharing too much data with developers.\nSo why does Facebook think its Hail Mary has a better chance of success?\nAt the same time, the case contains numerous incriminating emails suggesting that Facebook executives acted knowingly to reduce competition by making acquisitions including Instagram and WhatsApp. And the states\u2019 suit in particular articulated a compelling theory of harm: that Facebook\u2019s privacy policies worsened as competition decreased, making life worse for the average consumer. This is important because recent antitrust law has focused on cases that have caused prices to rise for consumers; companies like Facebook (and Google and Amazon) have escaped scrutiny until now in large part because they offer their services for free.\nIt\u2019s against that backdrop that I read Facebook\u2019s response to the government, which it filed in court on Wednesday. Here\u2019s Brent Kendall in The Wall Street Journal:\n\nFacebook on Wednesday asked a federal judge to dismiss antitrust lawsuits by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general, arguing that government enforcers have no valid basis for alleging the social media giant is suppressing competition.\nThe FTC \u201cutterly ignores the reality of the dynamic, intensely competitive high-tech industry in which Facebook operates,\u201d the company said in seeking to dismiss the commission\u2019s case. In a second motion, Facebook argued the states\u2019 case \u201cdoes not and cannot assert that their citizens paid higher prices, that output was reduced, or that any objective measure of quality declined as a result of Facebook\u2019s challenged actions.\u201d\n\nA motion like this is, on one hand, totally expected \u2014 if you\u2019re Facebook, why not try to get this case thrown out as soon as possible \u2014 and, on the other hand, unlikely to succeed. No matter how wobbly the government\u2019s case against Facebook appears from Silicon Valley, it is the product of years of investigation. I imagine a judge would be inclined to at least let the government make its case at trial, but we\u2019ll see.\nAt the same time, Google \u2014 which is facing a similar set of US antitrust lawsuits \u2014 declined to filed such a motion when presented with the opportunity last year. So why does Facebook think its Hail Mary has a better chance of success?\nThe company laid out its arguments in a blog post yesterday. As expected, it complains about the government\u2019s tortured efforts to define a market small enough for Facebook to credibly monopolize. It complains that the government cannot specify what exclusionary things it did in the wake of purchasing Instagram or WhatsApp, or restricting access to its data, that actually broke the law. And it raises various questions of standing and timing that I won\u2019t try to assess here.\nIn response, the government dismissed these arguments, though not in any great level of detail.\n\u201cFacebook is wrong on the law and wrong on our complaint,\u201d New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the states\u2019 case, told The Verge. \u201cWe are confident in our case, which is why almost every state in this nation has joined our bipartisan lawsuit to end Facebook\u2019s illegal conduct. We will continue to stand up for the millions of consumers and many small businesses that have been harmed by Facebook\u2019s unlawful behavior.\u201d\n\nII.\nIs there a better case to be made against Facebook than the antitrust complaints that actually got filed?\nI wondered that while rereading this great 2018 David Streitfeld profile of Lina Khan, who President Biden will reportedly nominate to the FTC. Khan helped inspire the current antitrust moment with a widely read paper, \u201cAmazon\u2019s Antitrust Paradox,\u201d which moved the discussion of competition issues away from a decades-long focus on price increases.\n\u201cWe\u2019re finally beginning to examine how antitrust laws, which were rooted in deep suspicion of concentrated private power, now often promote it,\u201d Khan told Streitfeld.\nThis has been a necessary and productive reversal. As more of our lives move online, we can\u2019t help but notice all the ways in which our activities are enabled and monitored by a small handful of West Coast companies.\nA badly written lawsuit could still succeed at trial \u2014 but first it has to make it there\nFacebook owns three of the most popular apps in the world; is a primary news source for billions; hosts a significant portion of global political speech; runs a large marketplace for physical goods; is building a significant consumer hardware division; and developed a cryptocurrency (now operated by a consortium) intended to power a worldwide payments network.\nIt is a quasi-state operating in parallel with all the other nations where it exists.\nLaws that were truly rooted in a suspicion of concentrated power, I think, might have intervened earlier in this state of affairs. Regulators could have expressed more skepticism about acquisitions; crafted a national privacy law; or written standards for data portability. They could have required Facebook to offer nondiscriminatory access to parts of its infrastructure, as if it were a public utility.\nNone of which would have required rethinking antitrust laws that may not be suited to the purpose that regulators are now pursuing.\nPerhaps existing laws will turn out to be well-suited for that purpose after all. Perhaps the newly Democratic Congress will write some new ones, as they have long been promising to do.\nOr perhaps, given that the consumer internet is now the most competitive it has been in the past half-decade or so, it won\u2019t much matter either way.\nI don\u2019t think Facebook\u2019s motion to dismiss is likely to end the government\u2019s ambitions to rein in the company. But it does highlight the steep challenge facing the FTC in the short term. A badly written lawsuit could still succeed at trial \u2014 but first it has to make it there.\n\nThis column was co-published with Platformer, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.","Author":"Casey Newton"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 12:00pm EST","Title":"GM aims to make its electric vehicles go farther and cost less with new battery partnership","Article":"General Motors announced a new joint venture with SolidEnergy Systems, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries. The two companies plan on building a test facility in Woburn, Massachusetts, for a high-capacity preproduction battery by 2023.\nThe partnership was announced Thursday by GM president Mark Reuss at a Washington Post Live virtual conference. Prior to the announcement, The Verge spoke with Kent Helfrich, executive director of GM\u2019s global electrification and battery systems, about what the joint venture will mean for the automaker\u2019s plans to electrify its entire fleet of vehicles by 2035. \n\u201cIn the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost\u201d\n\u201cIn the long run, what this is going to mean is more range and lower cost,\u201d Helfrich said. \u201cAnd it\u2019ll also mean most likely smaller batteries, so a lighter weight vehicle.\u201d\nWhen GM first unveiled its modular Ultium battery platform last year, it said the new energy system would enable electric vehicles that could travel \u201c400 miles or more\u201d on a single charge. Last November, the automaker increased the estimated maximum range to 450 miles. The first vehicle to be built with an Ultium battery will be the forthcoming GMC Hummer EV, which the company says will have an estimated 350 miles of range. The Hummer is expected to go into production at the end of 2021. \nThe company is sticking with its estimate of 450 miles of range for now, declining to speculate as to how many more miles it anticipates adding through its battery venture with SolidEnergy Systems. That company has been focused on improving the energy density in li-ion batteries for nearly a decade. According to MIT:\nFounded in 2012 by MIT alumnus and former postdoc Qichao Hu \u201907, SolidEnergy Systems has developed an \u201canode-free\u201d lithium metal battery with several material advances that make it twice as energy-dense, yet just as safe and long-lasting as the lithium ion batteries used in smartphones, electric cars, wearables, drones, and other devices.\nGM is interested in the company\u2019s intellectual property, which includes the manufacturing process for lithium metal anodes and electrolytes to improve the battery\u2019s overall life cycle. \n\u201cAnode-free\u201d lithium metal battery\nDespite its name, SolidEnergy still works with liquid electrolytes and does not consider itself a \u201csolid-state\u201d battery company. Solid-state systems have been the subject of intense focus from the auto industry in recent years, as companies seek to develop EV batteries that will charge faster, hold more power, and last longer than traditional EV batteries. \nWhile the focus of this joint venture with SolidEnergy is the production of \u201cwet\u201d li-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes, GM is looking closely at solid-state technology for the future. \u201cIs our advanced team also looking at solid state type technology? Absolutely,\u201d Mike Lelli, senior manager of advanced battery cell technology, said. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t leave anything off the table at this point.\u201d\nLast year, a top GM official said the company was \u201calmost there\u201d on developing an electric vehicle battery that will last 1 million miles. Speaking to a group of investors, GM executive VP Doug Parks wouldn\u2019t specify a timeline, but said \u201cmultiple teams\u201d at the automaker are working on such advances as zero-cobalt electrodes, solid-state batteries, and ultra-fast charging. Typical EV batteries today last up to 100,000 to 200,000 miles. \nGM has been an investor in SolidEnergy Systems since 2015 through its venture capital arm, but it isn\u2019t the only battery startup to attract the automaker\u2019s interest. In 2010, GM invested $3.2 million in a Michigan-based company called Sakti3 that was working on solid-state batteries. The automaker is also in talks to construct a second massive battery factory in the US. \nBut GM isn\u2019t the only company to view advances in EV batteries as a way to accelerate the future in which zero-emission vehicles replace all of the gas-guzzling cars on the road today. Last year, Tesla announced its own plan to take more control over its battery-making process.

It\u2019s been more than a year, really: the first COVID-19 case in the United States was reported on January 21st, 2020. The emergency was invisibly building in the US even before that. But a year ago today, the scale of the threat was pushed into view, and the outbreak became a pandemic. \nIt\u2019s hard to recapture the specific feelings of last March. There was a particular mixture of confusion, fear, numbness, and denial hanging in the background of everything, and most of the month was a blur. But within that miasma of badness, specific moments stand out. Those vivid signposts are the things I remember most clearly when I think back to a year ago: a de-stressing collage I made from old magazines, a miniature bottle of hand sanitizer, a specific trip to the bagel shop, the things I panic-bought on Amazon. \nEveryone has their own unique markers of the days when things changed. I asked The Verge staff to share theirs. Luckily, there are brighter days ahead. \n\nMy favorite relic of the first weeks of the pandemic is the 76.5-ounce canister of lemon-lime Gatorade powder I bought on Amazon. Everything was so scary and so new, and my instinct was to get everything I might need if I (or someone I knew) got sick. Enough powder to make nine gallons of Gatorade seemed reasonable at the time.

I remember being grateful that I already had a couple of reusable face masks leftover from when we had to have some exterminators come the year before. But I didn\u2019t know if those two would last, and you couldn\u2019t find any to buy, so I did some research, asked some of the other Verge folks what they were doing, and hand-sewed a rather neat little mask from an old bedsheet (which I ended up never actually using). I remember several friends with sewing machines were sewing face masks to send to hospitals because the demand was so huge that medical personnel were running short, and cloth masks were better than none at all.\nThe other hard-to-get pandemic item was hand sanitizer. Again, it was simply not available, and I researched what you had to use to make your own, including what kind of alcohol and what strength it had to be. (I actually ended up writing an article about it.) I managed to score the aloe vera gel I needed at a local health food store but was never able to get the alcohol at the strength demanded \u2014 by the time it was available, I was able to purchase hand sanitizer at my local supermarket anyway.

After that day, it seemed like everyone talked about COVID-19 a little differently.\nA year on, I\u2019m glad that many are now vaccinated and that hopefully soon, many more will be. But I also wonder how we\u2019ll all be irrevocably changed from our time in the pandemic. \u2014 Jay Peters \n\nBy the time the WHO made the official call that we were in a pandemic, the swirling fear and unrelenting news had already started messing with our heads. Just a few weeks into living and working at home, and we started to lose track of what day of the week it was. My family would sit down for dinner, look at each other, and try to remember if we\u2019d just finished our Thursday zoom meetings or if it was only Tuesday. Eventually, we started raising a glass to the day of the week. \u201cMonday?\u201d \u201cMonday.\u201d <clink> We still do it every night.  \u2014Mary Beth Griggs\nwe started to lose track of what day of the week it was\n\nOn March 10th, I took a selfie with a woman who had fallen asleep on me during my commute home. I joked that \u201csocial distancing in NYC is going great!\u201d The next day, I showed up to the office and only a handful of my colleagues were in, but all of the snacks were gone. I had a few bags of chips stowed away at my desk, and I used chopsticks to eat them because I was afraid of touching my mouth.  \u2014Cory Zapatka \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo snacks in the office.\nPhoto by Cory Zapatka \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n\nI distinctly remember taking the dog for an early morning walk around this time last year and being shocked that there were no cars \u2014 literally none \u2014 on what\u2019s usually a very traffick-y road into Downtown Pittsburgh. It was eerily quiet, and it was the first time it hit home for me how huge the situation really was. Now, whenever I venture out in the car, the lack of traffic is actually really nice, if still a bit disconcerting. I\u2019m hopeful this might make us rethink our dependence on cars, but I think it\u2019s too early to tell whether the lack of traffic will become a permanent result of the pandemic.  \u2014Kim Lyons\n\n\u201cToday is Thursday\u201d was trending on Twitter on March 19th, and several Verge staffers started musing about how an automated reminder of what day of the week it was would be nice. \nA bit of tinkering and a few hours later, and @TodaysDayToday was born: a Twitter account that, once a day, at 9AM ET, tweets what day of the week it is. Is it a useful Twitter account? Not exactly, but I do find it strangely comforting to see each morning, even a year later. And despite the timeless, WFH pandemic void, some things never changed: people still love Fridays and dread Mondays, if replies to the bot are anything to go by. \nOne year later, and time keeps on moving forward. Things might almost start looking like normal again soon. But my little Twitter bot will still keep ticking on, too. And in case you were wondering: today is Thursday.  \u2014Chaim Gartenberg\n\n\nToday is Thursday.\u2014 What day is it today? (@TodaysDayToday) March 11, 2021\n\n\n\n\nAt the very beginning of the pandemic, our entire family had COVID and didn\u2019t know it. My husband had gotten a false positive flu test, I spent about three weeks in bed with exhaustion and low appetite, our older son had fever and chills for two days, and our daughter had a fever for a morning that never returned after taking Motrin. But there were no tests around and nothing to do about it. And the positive flu test gave us hope. Then one day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn\u2019t able to smell the Clorox. \nOne day, as I was cleaning the bathroom, I wasn\u2019t able to smell the Clorox\nMy husband who has year-round allergies and can never smell couldn\u2019t help me. Our housekeeper who hadn\u2019t been there in over three weeks assured me that the bleach was not watered down. But no matter how much I sniffed, I could not smell the faintest trace of bleach. I felt like I was losing my mind. I finally decided to spray my clothes, and, alas, within seconds they were covered in bleach stains. Not long after, reports came out about COVID\u2019s effects relating to loss of smell and taste. Antibody tests confirmed we had had it, but the memory of me frantically running around our apartment spraying myself with bleach will stay with us forever.  \u2014Esther Cohen\n\n2020 was going to be my first year living on my own, and the newfound independence was exhilarating. Then March came roaring in with a pandemic that trapped me in my apartment. At the beginning of the month, when the pandemic was still mostly just an ominous cloud on the horizon, I stumbled across the most precious dog online. Her name was Trudee. I had been wanting a dog for months, so I put in an application to the local rescue. After several interviews, I was approved to adopt her. \nOn March 17th, I drove from Columbus to Cleveland to pick her up. The highways were unusually empty. On March 18th, Ohio\u2019s governor began to shut down businesses across the state. It was when this call came that I realized I was facing weeks or even months of loneliness in this apartment I was once so excited to be in. I remember hanging my head and crying out of fear of the isolation inside and the deadly disease outside. Trudee, however, was my saving grace. She kept the loneliness at bay, and we\u2019ve been inseparable since.  \u2014Kaitlin Hatton\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrudee!\nPhoto by Kaitlin Hatton \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n\nThe pandemic\u2019s start was actually supposed to be one of the coolest work trips of my career: a super-secret visit to Seattle, where I would play Valve\u2019s then-upcoming Half-Life: Alyx. Valve wisely canceled the trip and let reporters play Alyx at home instead, and within a few days, I was in self-quarantine at the virus epicenter in New York City after an employee at Vox\u2019s offices tested positive for COVID-19.\nThe result is that I spent the early pandemic locked inside my apartment with a giant batch of mushy homemade enchiladas, wearing a VR headset I brought home on my very last trip from our office, trying to write something that sounded like a normal review for a major video game franchise instead of a panicky dispatch from a plague exclusion zone. It\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve ever introduced a developer interview by casually mentioning the local disease death toll. (I guess it was 125 back then, which is heartbreakingly low in retrospect since, within weeks, the city would watch bodies pile up in freezers and a mass grave.)\n\u2018Half-Life: Alyx\u2019 is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.\nI rewrote the opening paragraph to that article about 50 times, and that was the least dramatic version I came up with. Because outside VR, all I remember is grief and fury. Spending every night listening to ambulances flood the local hospital, waking up to smug pundits and politicians insisting the pandemic wasn\u2019t real, mocking New Yorkers for being afraid of a disease nobody could cure or understand. Worrying a vicious sore throat I\u2019d had in early March was actually COVID-19, edging around the idea I\u2019d infected somebody else and killed them. Watching footage of people lining up for hours hoping to get tested, while the president called the whole thing a hoax. And then \u2014 where was I? Right. Video games.\nLong story short, Half-Life: Alyx is a very good VR shooter about space zombies. And 30,000 people in my city are dead.  \u2014Adi Robertson\n\nI was in Austin, Texas, profiling the eccentric brothers behind The Chive when stuff started to get really weird. It was March 11th \u2014 the World Health Organization had just declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. I remember sitting in my hotel room wondering if I\u2019d made a big mistake. Was I going to get stuck in Texas? My editor, Kevin Nguyen, had asked me before I left if I felt comfortable traveling, and I\u2019d answered honestly when I said yes. But now I felt really vulnerable. There was so much uncertainty \u2014 rumors that had seemed quite outlandish (they\u2019re going to shut down air travel!) were suddenly within the realm of possibility. I bought hand sanitizer since The Chive guys were big on shaking hands.  \u2014Zo\u00eb Schiffer\n\nThe last time I went to our office was on March 3rd, the day after I wrote about how we had no idea how widely the virus was spreading because our testing was insufficient. The only reason I went was to record a Vergecast episode; I\u2019d already decided at that point it was wisest to avoid public transit. As I did not own a car, that meant staying home.\nBy then, I\u2019d already panic-bought a bunch of nonperishable food items, cold medicine, and some bleach since I\u2019d missed my Wednesday evening yoga class on February 26th to write about a possible community-acquired case in the Bay Area where I live; after that, stocking up only seemed natural. If you\u2019re going to panic, I figured, better to panic before everyone else. At that point, I still believed the CDC was competent and any kind of shutdown would only last a month or so, the way it did in other countries.\nAt that point, I still believed the CDC was competent\nMarch 11th was also a Wednesday. My boyfriend and I went into our yoga class, and when we came out, Tom Hanks had been diagnosed and the NBA had canceled its season. He and I then proceeded to get into a giant fight \u2014 the only thing I was still doing was studio workout classes. He insisted, correctly, that I shouldn\u2019t go to them anymore.\nAlso around that time, I lost faith that the US government would do anything to prevent coronavirus from becoming widespread. We\u2019d been reporting on this threat for months, along with a lot of other outlets, and no one was taking it seriously. What was the point of our work? I still wonder about that; I have wondered about it every time we\u2019ve reached a new grim milestone of death.\nThe fight I had with my boyfriend turned out to be irrelevant; the Bay Area shut down on March 16th. My yoga studio, where I\u2019d gone four or five times a week for eight years, went out of business that summer.  \u2014Liz Lopatto\n\n\nA chronological sampling of events from the day that was Wednesday, March 11. pic.twitter.com\/0ez6Oi9Mgv\u2014 Bryan Fischer (@BryanDFischer) March 12, 2020\n\n\n\n\nI remember a few things very clearly about the day Philly started its lockdown. I was working at a library, and I had decided to reorganize our big supply closet. I remember leaving the closet half-organized, with little piles of folders and labels on the floor that I\u2019d \u201cget to tomorrow.\u201d Turns out, tomorrow wasn\u2019t coming. I lost that job a month later, and I have no idea if anyone ever finished up tidying. \nWhen our boss told us to head home, my co-workers and I decided to grab a few books and DVDs to entertain ourselves while we were stuck at home. There was a funny \u201ckids in a candy shop\u201d feeling: a bunch of library workers moseying around the stacks of an empty library, taking our pick of materials to hunker down with. I think we thought, naively in retrospect, that it might be a few weeks of working from home and then back to normal. A year later, I still have my pile of library books, tucked in a box that I use as a footrest at my desk. (Library friends, if you\u2019re reading this, I swear I will return them eventually.)\nI was too terrified to take the train or a ride-share home that day, so I hitched a ride with my equally terrified partner. We stopped at a few grocery stores (no toilet paper in sight) and a liquor store on the way. There was a bottle of Corona on the shelf outfitted with the head and legs of a virus, and I stared at it for a long moment trying to decide if it was cute or horribly morbid.  \u2014Kait Sanchez\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA liquor store display in Deptford, New Jersey.\nPhoto by Kait Sanchez \/ The Verge\n\n\n\n\nI have bad anxiety, so I stocked up on nonperishables and hand sanitizer in late February. During my last commute home from work, I didn\u2019t have any gloves so I placed (obviously clean and unused) dog poop bags over my hands so I could hold the pole on the train. \nI remember people telling me I must be so relieved that my wedding was set for August 28th, and that this would all blow over by then.\nI had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever\nMy parents and wedding caterer are both in upstate New York, and my partner and I were too scared of potentially spreading it to them to drive up. So my parents volunteered to go to the wedding tasting for us on March 14th. I FaceTimed them from my MacBook while they tried stuffed mushrooms, sweet and sour meatballs, and goat cheese puffs. I nodded along while I Googled \u201cDIY sourdough starter\u201d in the background. I am an eternal pessimist, so at that point, I had already resigned myself to having to stay home, probably forever. The wedding would obviously have to be postponed. I would never leave the house again! Therefore, my main concern, other than the crushing feeling of the world crumbling around me, was that all of my friends were showing off beautiful loaves of bread on Instagram \u2014 and I hadn\u2019t picked up yeast during my grocery run. \nWe decided to postpone the wedding by the end of March. My sourdough starter died a few days later. I cried when I scraped it into the trash, and then again, a week later, when I described it to my therapist over Zoom.  \u2014Sarah Smithers \n\nThe Verge has covered too many events to count in the past decade, so we were prepared to notice them crumble when COVID began to rampage across the globe. I started a simple website to track them, called Is It Canceled Yet? (I even nabbed the isitcanceledyet.com domain. Sweet.) From E3 to the Olympics, there was plenty of material to monitor.\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nisitcanceledyet.com\n\n\n\nThe project was mostly lighthearted and dusted lightly with humor when the cancellations were coming at a trickle and when we had some optimism that everyone would come together to shut down the spread of the virus. But then we learned our government and many of our neighbors wouldn\u2019t take it seriously, and the trickle became a flood, and now 500,000 Americans are dead. \nIn the span of a day or two, the Is It Canceled Yet? site became too popular and too difficult for me to manage. People started pointing to it as a serious resource for knowledge about our decaying world; literally hundreds of people were tweeting at me and emailing me asking me to add things to the list or notifying me of changes. Unable to dedicate enough of my time to make the site useful and comprehensive, Is It Canceled Yet? became just another thing that was canceled.  \u2014T.C. Sottek \n\nI moved into my own apartment two weeks before New York locked down. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever lived alone in the city \u2014 a longtime dream realized after years of meticulous saving and roommates who didn\u2019t understand the concept of chores. I spent the days immediately after my move eating pizza on the floor and wishing I never had to leave.\nThe weeks that followed had no real shape. I remember dodging around other New Yorkers on the street to keep six feet between us when we were being told not to wear masks. That I had a healthy supply of hand sanitizer already from years of covering gaming conventions. How being out after sundown suddenly felt illicit; how being out at all felt dangerous. Dread and dark humor held hands during my unexpected isolation. One hour, I\u2019d be crying hysterically until my eyes were nearly swollen shut; the next, I\u2019d be giving myself a wax in the stupidest, most optimistic pastime I\u2019ve had all quarantine. \nI can\u2019t tell you much about those first weeks or even the past year. Only a few moments have left a strong impression, and they\u2019re best saved for therapy. But to the man who sold me this monkey\u2019s paw: you were not clear enough on the fine print. \u2014Megan Farokhmanesh\nUpdate, March 11, 2:27 PM ET: Updated with additional blurbs.","Author":"Nicole Wetsman"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 11:46am EST","Title":"Soon you\u2019ll be able to buy a one-foot-tall figurine of ChilledCow\u2019s lo-fi chill beats anime girl","Article":"Jesus.

More users and more engagement equals more revenue. The cost of that single-mindedness is spelled out clearly in this brilliant story from MIT Technology Review. It details how attempts to tackle misinformation by the company\u2019s AI team using machine learning were apparently stymied by Facebook\u2019s unwillingness to limit user engagement.\n\u201cIf a model reduces engagement too much, it\u2019s discarded. Otherwise, it\u2019s deployed and continually monitored,\u201d writes author Karen Hao of Facebook\u2019s machine learning models. \u201cBut this approach soon caused issues. The models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism: put simply, people just like outrageous stuff.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing\u201d\nOn Twitter, Hao noted that the article is not about \u201ccorrupt people [doing] corrupt things.\u201d Instead, she says, \u201cIt\u2019s about good people genuinely trying to do the right thing. But they\u2019re trapped in a rotten system, trying their best to push the status quo that won\u2019t budge.\u201d\nThe story also adds more evidence to the accusation that Facebook\u2019s desire to placate conservatives during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency led to it turning a blind eye to right-wing misinformation. This seems to have happened at least in part due to the influence of Joel Kaplan, a former member of George W. Bush\u2019s administration who is now Facebook\u2019s vice president of global public policy and \u201cits highest-ranking Republican.\u201d As Hao writes:\n\nAll Facebook users have some 200 \u201ctraits\u201d attached to their profile. These include various dimensions submitted by users or estimated by machine-learning models, such as race, political and religious leanings, socioeconomic class, and level of education. Kaplan\u2019s team began using the traits to assemble custom user segments that reflected largely conservative interests: users who engaged with conservative content, groups, and pages, for example. Then they\u2019d run special analyses to see how content-moderation decisions would affect posts from those segments, according to a former researcher whose work was subject to those reviews.\nThe Fairness Flow documentation, which the Responsible AI team wrote later, includes a case study on how to use the tool in such a situation. When deciding whether a misinformation model is fair with respect to political ideology, the team wrote, \u201cfairness\u201d does not mean the model should affect conservative and liberal users equally. If conservatives are posting a greater fraction of misinformation, as judged by public consensus, then the model should flag a greater fraction of conservative content. If liberals are posting more misinformation, it should flag their content more often too.\nBut members of Kaplan\u2019s team followed exactly the opposite approach: they took \u201cfairness\u201d to mean that these models should not affect conservatives more than liberals. When a model did so, they would stop its deployment and demand a change. Once, they blocked a medical-misinformation detector that had noticeably reduced the reach of anti-vaccine campaigns, the former researcher told me. They told the researchers that the model could not be deployed until the team fixed this discrepancy. But that effectively made the model meaningless. \u201cThere\u2019s no point, then,\u201d the researcher says. A model modified in that way \u201cwould have literally no impact on the actual problem\u201d of misinformation.\n\nThe story also says that the work by Facebook\u2019s AI researchers on the problem of algorithmic bias, in which machine learning models unintentionally discriminate against certain groups of users, has been undertaken, at least in part to preempt these same accusations of anti-conservative sentiment and forestall potential regulation by the US government. But pouring more resources into bias has meant ignoring problems involving misinformation and hate speech. Despite the company\u2019s lip service to AI fairness, the guiding principle, says Hao, is still the same as ever: growth, growth, growth.\n[T]esting algorithms for fairness is still largely optional at Facebook. None of the teams that work directly on Facebook\u2019s news feed, ad service, or other products are required to do it. Pay incentives are still tied to engagement and growth metrics. And while there are guidelines about which fairness definition to use in any given situation, they aren\u2019t enforced.\nYou can read Hao\u2019s full story at MIT Technology Review here.","Author":"James Vincent"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021, 12:04pm EST","Title":"Bumble\u2019s new Night In feature is an attempt to break the ice on virtual dates","Article":"Dating app Bumble has announced Night In, a new feature that lets you play games on a virtual date.

In fact, Hyundai describes the Staria\u2019s exterior as \u201cstrikingly futuristic and mysterious ... resembling a spaceship\u201d in the press release, so maybe this is just my personal preference for this style showing.

Additionally, nine people were murdered during Uber rides, and 58 people died in auto-related crashes.

Also in 2019, 19 women sued Lyft for allegedly failing to prevent sexual assault perpetrated by drivers on the platform and for doing little to investigate the complaints. A California woman who says she was raped by a Lyft driver in 2017 also sued the company in September over failing to keep riders safe, while 14 additional women sued Lyft earlier in September over its handling of sexual assault complaints.\nBoth companies conduct background checks and say passenger safety is their top priority.

That some language left some wiggle room for the possibility of future Bethesda titles to appear on Sony\u2019s PlayStation 5, Nintendo\u2019s Switch, or elsewhere. Now, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox chief, Phil Spencer, is making it very clear why the company paid $7.5 billion for Bethesda: Xbox Game Pass.\nSpeaking during a Bethesda and Xbox roundtable event today, Spencer revealed that Xbox Game Pass is at the heart of this Bethesda deal. \u201cIf you\u2019re an Xbox customer, the thing I want you to know is that this is about delivering great exclusive games for you that ship on platforms where Game Pass exists,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cThat\u2019s our goal, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing this, that\u2019s the root of this partnership that we\u2019re building.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not a surprising admission, as it has been obvious Microsoft has been gearing up for a different kind of Xbox future with its Xbox Game Pass subscription push.

In fact, it\u2019s the opposite. \u201cThere\u2019s contractual obligations that we\u2019re going to see through, as we always do in every one of these instances,\u201d says Spencer. \u201cWe have games that exist on other platforms, and we\u2019re gonna go support those games on the platforms they\u2019re on. There\u2019s communities of players and we love those communities and we\u2019ll continue to invest in them.\u201d\nMicrosoft and Bethesda only cleared the deal recently, so it\u2019s too early for any game announcements, but questions remain over Bethesda\u2019s new and upcoming Starfield title and even the recently announced Indiana Jones game. Will these both be exclusive to Xbox and PC? We simply don\u2019t know yet. Spencer did mention that \u201ceven in the future there might be things that have contractual things, or legacy on different platforms that we\u2019ll go do,\u201d so there could potentially be new Bethesda games appearing on non-Microsoft platforms.\nWhat\u2019s clear is that the long-term goal is for Bethesda to create exclusive games that will only be available on platforms where Xbox Game Pass is supported. At the moment, that\u2019s Xbox consoles, Windows PCs, Android phones, and soon, iOS devices via the web.\nHere\u2019s Spencer\u2019s full statement on Bethesda exclusivity:\nSo obviously I can\u2019t sit here and say every Bethesda game is exclusive, because we know that\u2019s not true.

There are also some fun interviews included, with the podcast featuring stories from Sean Parker, inventor of Napster, and Lars Ulrich of Metallica.\nIn the podcast, the Spotify founders discuss the history of piracy in Spotify\u2019s home country, Sweden, to give context about its development environment. It goes into the existence of Sweden\u2019s Pirate Party, an actual political party that once held several seats in the country\u2019s parliament. The founders also discuss how they wanted to take the ease of pirating music but make it legitimate. \nIf talk about being easier than piracy sounds familiar, it\u2019s probably because that was part of the pitch for the iTunes Music Store, too. It seems, for the most part, that iTunes and the iPod are pretty much completely ignored. The podcast presents music distribution as going from CD stores to Napster to Spotify. Apple and Spotify aren\u2019t the best of friends, but it\u2019s honestly somewhat hilarious to hear how the story completely ignores the fact that people could, in fact, buy digital music (an option that was around even before Spotify launched).\nDespite the lack of objectivity about the history of digital music, the technical depth alone makes it well worth a listen. The second episode (labeled 01) gets into how Spotify used the same peer-to-peer tech used by the pirates to build its legitimate music streaming service and how its approach blew people's minds at the time. Even though the story leaves some pretty important parts out, it\u2019s still worth a listen to hear the origins of the popular music (and, obviously, podcasting) service.","Author":"Mitchell Clark"},{"Date":"Mar 11, 2021,  3:47pm EST","Title":"Apple sues 11-year veteran MacBook designer for allegedly stealing trade secrets for a journalist","Article":"Apple is suing Simon Lancaster, a former product design architect at the company, accusing him of selling trade secrets and details on unreleased Apple products to an unnamed media correspondent.

There\u2019s no mention of any improvements specifically for users on iOS.\nThe exact benefits vary by OS. Across platforms, Google says Chrome is able to reclaim as much as 100MiB (or over 20 percent on some sites) by using foreground tab memory more efficiently, and on macOS it\u2019s saving up to 8 percent of its memory usage based on how it handles background tabs (something which Chrome already does on other platforms).

Today, Facebook announced a new initiative that it hopes will give it an edge in this consequential work: training its AI on Facebook users\u2019 public videos.\nAccess to training data is one of the biggest competitive advantages in AI, and by collecting this resource from millions and millions of their users, tech giants like Facebook, Google, and Amazon have been able to forge ahead in various areas. And while Facebook has already trained machine vision models on billions of images collected from Instagram, it hasn\u2019t previously announced projects of similar ambition for video understanding. \n\u201cpart of our broader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do\u201d\n\u201cBy learning from global streams of publicly available videos spanning nearly every country and hundreds of languages, our AI systems will not just improve accuracy but also adapt to our fast moving world and recognize the nuances and visual cues across different cultures and regions,\u201d said the company in a blog. The project, titled Learning from Videos, is also part of Facebook\u2019s \u201cbroader efforts toward building machines that learn like humans do.\u201d\nThe resulting machine learning models will be used to create new content recommendation systems and moderation tools, says Facebook, but could do so much more in the future. AI that can understand the content of videos could give Facebook unprecedented insight into users\u2019 lives, allowing them to analyze their hobbies and interests, preferences in brands and clothes, and countless other personal details. Of course, Facebook already has access to such information through its current ad-targeting operation, but being able to parse video through AI would add an incredibly rich (and invasive) source of data to its stores. \nFacebook is vague about its future plans for AI models trained on users\u2019 videos. The company told The Verge such models could be put to a number of uses, from captioning videos to creating advanced search functions, but did not answer a question on whether or not they would be used to collect information for ad-targeting. Similarly, when asked if users had to consent to having their videos used to train Facebook\u2019s AI or if they could opt out, the company responded only by noting that its Data Policy says users\u2019 uploaded content can be used for \u201cproduct research and development.\u201d Facebook also did not respond to questions asking exactly how much video will be collected for training its AI systems or how access to this data by the company\u2019s researchers will be overseen. \nIn its blog post announcing the project, though, the social network did point to one future, speculative use: using AI to retrieve \u201cdigital memories\u201d captured by smart glasses.\nFacebook plans to release a pair of consumer smart glasses sometime this year. Details about the device are vague, but it\u2019s likely these or future glasses will include integrated cameras to capture the wearer\u2019s point of view. If AI systems can be trained to understand the content of video, then it will allow users to search for past recordings, just as many photo apps allow people to search for specific locations, objects, or people. (This is information, incidentally, that has often been indexed by AI systems trained on user data.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook has released images showing prototype pairs of its augmented-reality smart glasses. \nImage: Facebook\n\n\nAs recording video with smart glasses \u201cbecomes the norm,\u201d says Facebook, \u201cpeople should be able to recall specific moments from their vast bank of digital memories just as easy as they capture them.\u201d It gives the example of a user conducting a search with the phrase \u201cShow me every time we sang happy birthday to Grandma,\u201d before being served relevant clips. As the company notes, such a search would require that AI systems establish connections between types of data, teaching them \u201cto match the phrase \u2018happy birthday\u2019 to cakes, candles, people singing various birthday songs, and more.\u201d Just like humans do, AI would need to understand rich concepts comprised of different types of sensory input. \nLooking to the future, the combination of smart glasses and machine learning would enable what\u2019s referred to as \u201cworldscraping\u201d \u2014 capturing granular data about the world by turning wearers of smart glasses into roving CCTV cameras. As the practice was described in a report last year from The Guardian: \u201cEvery time someone browsed a supermarket, their smart glasses would be recording real-time pricing data, stock levels and browsing habits; every time they opened up a newspaper, their glasses would know which stories they read, which adverts they looked at and which celebrity beach pictures their gaze lingered on.\u201d\nThis is an extreme outcome and not an avenue of research Facebook says it\u2019s currently exploring. But it does illustrate the potential significance of pairing advanced AI video analysis with smart glasses \u2014 which the social network is apparently keen to do.\nFacebook has deployed AI video models to recommend clips in Reels\nBy comparison, the only use of its new AI video analysis tools that Facebook is currently disclosing is relatively mundane. Along with the announcement of Learning from Videos today, Facebook says it\u2019s deployed a new content recommendation system based on its video work in its TikTok-clone Reels. \u201cPopular videos often consist of the same music set to the same dance moves, but created and acted by different people,\u201d says Facebook. By analyzing the content of videos, Facebook\u2019s AI can suggest similar clips to users. \nSuch content recommendation algorithms are not without potential problems, though. A recent report from MIT Technology Review highlighted how the social network\u2019s emphasis on growth and user engagement has stopped its AI team from fully addressing how algorithms can spread misinformation and encourage political polarization. As the Technology Review article says: \u201cThe [machine learning] models that maximize engagement also favor controversy, misinformation, and extremism.\u201d This creates a conflict between the duties of Facebook\u2019s AI ethics researchers and the company\u2019s credo of maximizing growth.\nFacebook isn\u2019t the only big tech company pursuing advanced AI video analysis, nor is it the only one to leverage users\u2019 data to do so. Google, for example, maintains a publicly accessible research dataset containing 8 million curated and partially labeled YouTube videos in order to \u201chelp accelerate research on large scale video understanding.\u201d The search giant\u2019s ad operations could similarly benefit from AI that understands the content of videos, even if the end result is simply serving more relevant ads in YouTube. \nFacebook, though, thinks it has one particular advantage over its competitors. Not only does it have ample training data, but it\u2019s pushing more and more resources into an AI method known as self-supervised learning. \nself-supervised learning is \u201cthe dark matter of intelligence.\u201d\nUsually, when AI models are trained on data, those inputs have be to labeled by humans: tagging objects in pictures or transcribing audio recordings, for example. If you\u2019ve ever solved a CAPTCHA identifying fire hydrants or pedestrian crossing then you\u2019ve likely labeled data that\u2019s helped to train AI. But self-supervised learning does away with the labels, speeding up the training process, and, some researchers believe, resulting in deeper and more meaningful analysis as the AI systems teach themselves to join the dots. Facebook is so optimistic about self-supervised learning it\u2019s called it \u201cthe dark matter of intelligence.\u201d\nThe company says its future work on AI video analysis will focus on semi- and self-supervised learning methods, and that such techniques \u201chave already improved our computer vision and speech recognition systems.\u201d With such an abundance of video content available from Facebook\u2019s 2.8 billion users, skipping the labeling part of AI training certainly makes sense. And if the social network can teach its machine learning models to understand video seamlessly, who knows what they might learn?","Author":"James Vincent"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  7:05am EST","Title":"These LED dice could electrify your next DnD campaign","Article":"Sometimes it\u2019s nice to get away from technology for a bit, settle down with some friends, and play an entire role-playing game using just pen, paper, and lots of dice.

The dice have launched on Kickstarter, with prices starting at $39. As of this writing, over 14,000 people have already backed the project for a total of over $2 million pledged.\nThe main attraction here is obviously the colorful RGB lighting, which creator Systemic Games promises will be customizable and programmable via a companion app. The Pixels are also waterproof, charge wirelessly via companion charging cases, and can go for around five hours on a charge, or more if you\u2019re willing to live without the lighting. A range of die styles are available, including D20, D12, D10, D8, D6, and D4.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRGB lighting illuminates the dice.\nImage: Systemic Games\n\n\nBut for me, the most interesting thing about the dice is how they\u2019ll apparently be able to communicate with Roll20, Foundry, and other online platforms that let you play tabletop games over the internet. At the moment a service like Roll20 relies on either virtual dice rolls, or rolling a traditional dice and then reporting back to your games master. In contrast, the Pixels could offer the best of both worlds, by letting you roll a physical die and automatically reporting the result.\nYes, there are a lot of obvious jokes to be made about not being able to play a pen-and-paper RPG because your dice aren\u2019t charged. But if you like the thought of having Bluetooth-enabled dice that light up like Christmas trees, then the Pixels are available to back on Kickstarter until April 8th. One die (including charger) starts at $39, or you can get a set of seven dice and a charging case for $199. All of the usual warnings about backing Kickstarters apply, but if all goes to plan the Pixels should ship in around 12 months.\n\n\nA note on crowdfunding:\nCrowdfunding is a chaotic field by nature: companies looking for funding tend to make big promises. According to a study run by Kickstarter in 2015, roughly 1 in 10 \u201csuccessful\u201d products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there\u2019s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. \nThe best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? \nAnd remember: you\u2019re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.","Author":"Jon Porter"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 10:04am EST","Title":"Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 20 phones are up to $500 off today at Woot","Article":"Woot has discounted Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Note 20 line today, with up to $500 in savings available depending on which phone you buy.

Marco Rubio endorses Amazon warehouse union drive in surprise op-ed","Article":"Writing in USA Today on Friday, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) made a surprise endorsement of a fledgling union at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. In the op-ed, Rubio frames the union drive as a necessary response to the encroaching power of Amazon, a longtime target for Republicans.\n\u201cWhen the conflict is between working Americans and a company whose leadership has decided to wage culture war against working-class values, the choice is easy \u2014 I support the workers,\u201d Rubio writes in the op-ed. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why I stand with those at Amazon\u2019s Bessemer warehouse today.\u201d\nRubio says Amazon \u201cwages culture war against working-class values\u201d\nWorkers at the Bessemer warehouse are in the process of voting on whether to unionize, as overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. Amazon had sought to delay the vote or require in-person voting, but both efforts were ultimately unsuccessful. The election process will conclude at the end of the month, with a simple majority required to certify the union.\nThe Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, which will represent the Bessemer workers if the union drive is successful, applauded the op-ed. \u201cWe welcome support from all quarters,\u201d said RWDSU president Stuart Appelbaum in a statement. \u201cSenator Rubio\u2019s support demonstrates that the best way for working people to achieve dignity and respect in the workplace is through unionization. This should not be a partisan issue.\u201d\nAmazon has mounted an aggressive campaign in opposition to the union drive, posting materials on the worksite and running digital ads across a variety of platforms highlighting the benefits of a union-free workplace. In one incident, Amazon managers worked with local county officials to alter the timing on a streetlight near the warehouse, a move union organizers believe was made in order to hamper the union campaign.\nComing from a conservative Republican, the endorsement will surprise many \u2014 but it\u2019s not the first time Rubio has offered measured support to labor unions. In an Atlantic essay in December 2018, he wrote \u201cany discussion of the dignity of work should mention unions,\u201d referring back to his father\u2019s experience with the Culinary Workers Union. \nNotably, the op-ed stops short of a general endorsement of organized labor, maintaining that \u201cadversarial labor relations are generally harmful.\u201d Rubio also frames his support for the union in conservative terms, presenting it as a bulwark against cultural liberalism in the workplace. \u201cToday it might be workplace conditions,\u201d the Senator writes, \u201cbut tomorrow it might be a requirement that the workers embrace management\u2019s latest \u2018woke\u2019 human resources fad.\u201d\nThe op-ed comes after a video statement from President Biden earlier this month, which expressed broad support for workers\u2019 right to unionize at the Alabama site and elsewhere, warning employers against anti-union efforts in a phrase that many saw as aimed at Amazon. \u201cThere should be no intimidation,\u201d Biden says in the video, \u201cno coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda.\u201d\nThe fight over the Bessemer union drive is due to come before Congress as soon as next week. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been invited to testify on Wednesday before the Senate Budget Committee next week, on the same day a worker from the Bessemer plant is scheduled to speak.\nThe committee is chaired by Sen. Bernie Sanders (D-VT), one of the earliest Congressional supporters of the Bessemer organizing campaign. \u201cIt cannot be overstated how powerful it will be if Amazon workers in Alabama vote to form a union,\u201d Sanders said in February. \u201cIf they win, it will not only improve wages and working conditions in Bessemer, but it will also send a shockwave around the country.\u201d","Author":"Russell Brandom"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 11:30am EST","Title":"Almost all of LG\u2019s Android 11 updates aren\u2019t coming until the end of 2021","Article":"LG\u2019s German website has revealed its Android 11 update roadmap \u2014 at least for Europe \u2014 and the news isn\u2019t too encouraging.

Hindenburg says in the report, published Friday, that it has taken an unspecified short position in Lordstown Motors, meaning it stands to make money from the startup\u2019s stock price falling. \nThe accusations from Hindenburg could also raise questions about General Motors and the due diligence it does on the startups it backs. GM, the biggest automaker in the US, had previously planned to take a big stake in Nikola before Hindenburg\u2019s report came out last year. \nLordstown Motors got big support from the Trump administration\nGM has backed Lordstown Motors since its inception and has a seat on the startup\u2019s board. It loaned Lordstown Motors $40 million so the startup could buy a plant that GM shuttered in Lordstown, Ohio \u2014 a deal praised by then-president Donald Trump that eventually led to a White House photo-op and then-Vice President Mike Pence appearing at the Endurance unveiling event.\nGM also invested more money and made other contributions (for a total value of $75 million) to Lordstown Motors as part of its merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, which turned the startup into a publicly listed company on the Nasdaq stock exchange and helped it raise nearly $700 million total. (The startup has since said it\u2019s in the \u201cdue diligence\u201d phase of obtaining a loan from the Department of Energy (DOE), too.)\n\u201cThe $75 million investment from General Motors in LMC included certain in kind contributions that have already been provided to Lordstown. These include the plant itself. We have nothing to say about the report,\u201d GM\u2019s director of finance and sales communications James Cain said in an email. \n\u201cWe will be sharing a full and thorough statement in the coming days, and when we do we will absolutely be refuting the Hindenburg Research report,\u201d Lordstown Motors said in a statement late Friday. The DOE declined to comment.\nLordstown Motors has claimed to have presold 100,000 pickup trucks to date. But Hindenburg accuses Lordstown Motors founder and CEO Steve Burns of paying consultants to preorder the startup\u2019s electric pickup truck \u2014 something Burns confirmed to The Wall Street Journal on Friday.\nThe firm claims multiple big-batch orders for the truck were from companies that either exist mostly on paper or don\u2019t operate vehicle fleets to begin with. One order for 14,000 trucks \u2014 which would cost more than $700 million \u2014 was placed by a Texas company with just two employees on LinkedIn. Another order for 1,000 Endurances was from a similarly small company, the CEO of which allegedly told Hindenburg he had no plans to buy the trucks.\nHindenburg also includes claims in its report that some preorders are nonbinding and require no money upfront, though this is a practice that has been common among startups in the space that try to book orders before getting a vehicle to production. \nSome big orders came from companies that basically only exist on paper\nWhile Burns has stuck to a September 2021 date for getting the startup\u2019s pickup into production, Hindenburg says it spoke to former employees who believe the truck is at least three years away from being ready, including one who allegedly claimed that the startup has not completed cold weather and other testing required by the government. The report also cites a local news report of one of the startup\u2019s prototype trucks catching fire in February as further evidence.\nWhat\u2019s more, Hindenburg discovered a previously unreported lawsuit filed against Lordstown Motors by EV startup Karma Automotive. In it, Karma accuses Lordstown Motors of trying to steal its infotainment system technology after initially trying to buy it.\nLordstown Motors\u2019 relationship to Burns\u2019 previous company, fellow Ohio EV startup Workhorse, is also called into question in the report. Burns founded Lordstown Motors shortly after leaving Workhorse in 2019, thought Hindenburg claims he was fired. Workhorse did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nAs it entered into the deal with GM to buy the Lordstown factory, Burns\u2019 new startup struck an agreement with Workhorse to license IP for a pickup truck that his former company was never able to get off the ground. Hindenburg claims that Workhorse was more than happy to unload the pickup truck. This deal has paid off handsomely so far for Workhorse, too, as Lordstown Motors paid $15.8 million for the IP, plus another $4.8 million when the new startup went public. Lordstown Motors also handed Workhorse a 10 percent stake that is now worth some $300 million based on the new startup\u2019s stock price as of the end of 2020.\nHindenburg obviously stands to benefit from any hit to Lordstown Motors\u2019 stock price. The firm\u2019s research into Nikola did lead to that startup performing an internal investigation, which turned up evidence that founder Trevor Milton did in fact make \u201cinaccurate\u201d statements about his company before he ultimately resigned. But Nikola claims the results of the investigation do not line up with Hindenburg\u2019s accusation that that the startup is an \u201cintricate fraud.\u201d Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission investigations into Nikola are currently ongoing. \nUpdate March 12th, 4:00PM ET: Added details about the Lordstown factory being included in the $75 million investment made by GM. \nUpdate March 12th, 5:34PM ET: Added comment from Lordstown Motors.","Author":"Sean O'Kane"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 10:38am EST","Title":"HBO Max will debut its cheaper, ad-supported tier in June","Article":"WarnerMedia is set to launch an ad-supported tier for its HBO Max streaming service this June, and executives are hoping that having a cheaper option will help boost subscriber growth. \nAT&T didn\u2019t provide additional information in a press release sent out, including price or exact launch date, but noted that HBO Max will also launch in about 60 markets outside of the US in 2021. Pricing announcements will be made in the coming months, WarnerMedia CEO Jason Kilar told analysts gathered for AT&T\u2019s analyst day. Considering we\u2019re half-way through March, a couple of months is basically launch. \nThe main difference between the ad-supported tier and the normal plan is access to same-day theatrical releases, Kilar added. Customers on the ad-supported plan won\u2019t be able to watch Dune on HBO Max when it lands, for example. Kilar also confirmed that ads won\u2019t play on HBO original titles like Euphoria, The Sopranos, and Game of Thrones.\n\u201cMost people on this planet are not wealthy\u201d\nAn ad-supported plan is just one way to help grow HBO Max\u2019s subscriber base. The expensive pricing tier ($15 a month) might be off-putting to a number of consumers. Kilar recently spoke about the incoming advertisement supported tier at the Goldman Sachs conference, noting that \u201cmost people on this planet are not wealthy.\u201d\n\u201cAnd so if we can wake up and use price and be able to kind of invent and do things elegantly through advertising to reduce the price of a service, I think that\u2019s a fantastic thing for fans,\u201d he said, as reported by Variety.\nExecutives seemingly have a lot of hope that an ad-supported tier will help subscriber count skyrocket. AT&T is raising subscriber targets for both 2021 and 2025, and the company now expects to end 2021 with roughly 67-70 million subscribers worldwide and end 2025 with anywhere between 120 and 125 million subscribers. \nThat\u2019s a massive increase compared to what executives touted previously \u2014 75 to 90 million \u2014 in October. HBO and HBO Max ended 2020 with a combined 41 million subscribers, but with one giant asterisk. Of the 37.7 million cable HBO subscribers, less than half actually activated their free HBO Max upgrade.  \nTwo of the biggest issues impacting HBO Max from the get-go were price and awareness. With the company trying to figure out a better approach to communicating what HBO Max is (and how it differs from HBO), and a cheaper plan soon available, executives are clearly expecting things to pick up. Of course, that\u2019s on top of measures taken to boost subscribers, including dropping new movies in 2021 on HBO Max the same day they\u2019re available in theaters. \nKilar did not comment on other streaming initiatives within WarnerMedia \u2014 the industry has speculated CNN could receive a streaming service to tap into a younger viewing base. But he did confirm sports will not be made available on HBO Max this year.

And for every young person without internet access, there\u2019s a \u201clost opportunity for new ideas and innovations that can serve humanity.\u201d \nThe breadth of the digital divide has come into sharp focus during the coronavirus pandemic, as people tried to work and learn from home, often on less-than-ideal internet connections. According to the Pew Research Center, in the US alone, only two-thirds of people living in rural areas have broadband access, compared to 79 percent of people living in suburbs. And the Federal Communications Commission\u2019s universally disliked broadband maps don\u2019t give a totally clear picture of the state of broadband access in the US. \nBerners-Lee and Leith write that worldwide, the problem is similarly bad. \u201cOnly the top third of under-25s have a home internet connection, according to UNICEF, leaving 2.2 billion young people without the stable access they need to learn online, which has helped so many others continue their education during the pandemic.\u201d\nBerners-Lee and Leith also cite the need to protect young people online from abuse and misinformation, \u201cwhich threatens their participation and can force them from platforms altogether,\u201d they write. \u201cThis is especially true for those disproportionately targeted on the basis of their race, religion, sexuality, abilities, and gender.\u201d\nThe pair call for access to the internet to be recognized as a basic right, and they say the costs of making sure every young person is connected \u201cis well within our reach. Through funding for network infrastructure, subsidies, and support for community networks, we can get the web into the hands of every young person on earth.\u201d \u201cAn all-out push to connect the world will make sure that young people do not fall through the cracks.\u201d\nBerners-Lee says internet access should be treated as a basic right\nBerners-Lee and Leith say that the Alliance for Affordable Internet (A4AI), an initiative of the Web Foundation, \u201chas calculated that $428 billion of additional investment over ten years would provide everyone a quality broadband connection. To put this in perspective, that amounts to the equivalent of just $116 per person for the 3.7 billion people who remain offline today.\u201d \nProviding universal broadband access within the next ten years \u201cwould deliver around $8.7 trillion in direct economic benefits,\u201d they write, citing a new analysis by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford not to do it.\u201d","Author":"Kim Lyons"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 11:16am EST","Title":"Google slams Microsoft for trying \u2018to break the way the open web works\u2019","Article":"Google and Microsoft engineers might collaborate on the Chromium browser code, but that hasn\u2019t stopped corporate politics between the pair. Google has launched a scathing attack on Microsoft today, accusing it of trying \u201cto break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.\u201d\nGoogle is upset about what it believes is an attack by Microsoft to undermine the company\u2019s efforts to support journalism and publishers. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, in response to a law that would force Google to pay news publishers for their content. Australia passed the law in February, just days after Google caved and cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers that ensured its services continue to be available in Australia. (Facebook, on the other hand, did remove the ability for users and publishers to share news content in the country, which earned some concessions from the Australian government.) \n\n\n    Related\n  \nAustralia passes law requiring Facebook and Google to pay for news content \n\nIn the middle of all of this, Microsoft was very public about its support of Australia\u2019s new law, and it even teamed up with European publishers to call for online platforms to reach deals to pay news outlets for content. Google isn\u2019t happy about Microsoft getting involved and this is the first big public spat we\u2019ve seen since the Scroogled era.\n\u201cThey are now making self-serving claims and are even willing to break the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival,\u201d says Kent Walker, Google\u2019s head of global affairs, in a blog post. \u201cThis latest attack marks a return to Microsoft\u2019s longtime practices. Walker links to the Wikipedia entry for Fear, uncertainty, and doubt (FUD), and accuses Microsoft of muddying the waters to distract from recent security issues. \n\u201cIt\u2019s no coincidence that Microsoft\u2019s newfound interest in attacking us comes on the heels of the SolarWinds attack and at a moment when they\u2019ve allowed tens of thousands of their customers ... to be actively hacked via major Microsoft vulnerabilities,\u201d says Walker. \u201cMicrosoft was warned about the vulnerabilities in their system, knew they were being exploited, and are now doing damage control while their customers scramble to pick up the pieces from what has been dubbed the Great Email Robbery. So maybe it\u2019s not surprising to see them dusting off the old diversionary Scroogled playbook.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\u2019s old Scroogled ads.\n\n\nThis unusual attack from Google also comes just as the House Judiciary Committee looks at the antitrust and commercial aspects of competition for a free and diverse press. Google argues it doesn\u2019t make money from Google News, but Microsoft argues it\u2019s a lot more complicated and involves Google Search ads, ad tech business, ad exchange, ad tech tools, and Google\u2019s overall consumer dataset.\n\u201cNews organizations have ad inventory to sell, but they can no longer sell directly to those who want to place ads,\u201d says Microsoft president Brad Smith. \u201cInstead, for all practical purposes they must use Google\u2019s tools, operate on Google\u2019s ad exchanges, contribute data to Google\u2019s operations, and pay Google money. All this impacts the ability of news organizations to benefit economically even from advertising on their own sites.\u201d\nGoogle and Microsoft are clearly at odds over the core argument of whether publishers should have more control over a digital ad industry dominated by the search giant and Facebook. Microsoft wants Congress to move forward with the Journalism Competition and Preservation Act and \u201cenable news organizations to negotiate collectively with online content distributors.\u201d \nGoogle, on the other hand, believes its Google News Initiative, where it tries to collaborate with the news industry, is enough to help news organizations. While Microsoft and Google battle in a war of words, the House Judiciary Committee is meeting today to hear less scathing arguments about the future of the press in a digital era.","Author":"Tom Warren"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021, 12:04pm EST","Title":"Disney\u2019s MagicMobile pass is a contactless alternative to the MagicBand","Article":"In 2013, Walt Disney World resort offered the MagicBands \u2014 a plastic bracelet that made it easy to perform numerous services such as park tickets.

Take this one, for example, made with an instrument called \u201cMario Paint\u201d that only vaguely sounds like something from Mario Paint\u2019s famous music composer:\n\n\nInstrument: Mario Paint Tempo: 60.0Played in the key of B. pic.twitter.com\/C1bfzqczaF\u2014 MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) March 10, 2021\n\n\n\nOr this one, which a friend described as like a computer trying to make a Black Keys song in a weird time signature:\n\n\nInstrument: Mini Saw Tempo: 90.0Played in the key of E. pic.twitter.com\/YxTw6bhBle\u2014 MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) March 11, 2021\n\n\n\nOr this one, which brings me to tears of joy every time I hear it, played by an instrument called \u201c1812 Cannons\u201d (which are surely inspired by the glorious cannons at the end of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201c1812 Overture\u201d). \n\n\nInstrument: 1812 Cannons Tempo: 90.0Played in the key of F. pic.twitter.com\/qOBv2BE8PF\u2014 MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) March 7, 2021\n\n\n\nSometimes, however, the bot inexplicably churns out something that\u2019s kind of good. This song wouldn\u2019t feel out of place in the right video game: \n\n\nInstrument: Sine Wave Tempo: 120.0Played in the key of A. pic.twitter.com\/i2ZF8vDIZJ\u2014 MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) March 9, 2021\n\n\n\nAnd this one just slaps: \n\n\nInstrument: Bass Hits 1 Tempo: 150.0Played in the key of Gb. pic.twitter.com\/CawyJnZxmE\u2014 MelodyBot3456 (@MelodyBot3456) March 12, 2021\n\n\n\nI strongly recommend just scrolling through the bot\u2019s tweets yourself and listening to anything that sounds vaguely interesting. Most of them will probably make you laugh, and every once in a while you\u2019ll find a gem. The account has been around since July 2019, so there\u2019s a lot to listen to.\nI will leave you with my absolute favorite melody from the week, performed by robot claves.

The new sort by time-to-read feature, spotted by The Verge\u2019s Dan Seifert, means articles can be organized where they fit best, whether it\u2019s the five minutes it takes to microwave lunch, or a 20-minute wait for the late bus.\nThe feature appears in both the search section of the app, and as a sorting feature in your main list. A reader can sort their saved article search by length, choosing from Quick (less than five minutes), Medium (six to ten minutes), Long (eleven to twelve minutes), and Very Long (over twenty-one minutes). Your list of saved articles can also be organized by newest saved, oldest saved, longest to read, and shortest read, according to Pocket\u2019s VP and General Manager Matt Koidin. If the feature proves popular, after Pocket \u201cmodernizes its iOS codebase,\u201d Koidin says the company will bring these sorting options to iOS and the web as well.\n\n\nI have wanted this feature in @Pocket for YEARS, thrilled it's finally a thing pic.twitter.com\/Xpaxkz4awm\u2014 dan seifert (@dcseifert) March 11, 2021\n\n\n\nIn my pre-pandemic life, when I used to ride the bus to work almost every day, I\u2019d constantly misjudge what I was getting myself into when deciding what to read. Pocket\u2019s pre-existing time-to-read stamps for articles help, but when you have a dragon\u2019s hoard of writing you wanted to read at some point, things get complicated. Finding an article that can fit into a typical commute time might help people actually finish reading what they care about.\nI assumed reading time was personalized, but Koidin says that Pocket actually bases its estimates on an average 220 words-per-minute reading speed. Now the hair on the back of my neck goes up when I think about great writing as a reading length first, rather than a holistic work of creative effort, but I think it\u2019s easy to see how useful this could be (if I wasn\u2019t shackled to an iPhone currently).\nCommutes might not be in the equation for everyone just yet, but for those who still travel to work regularly, the feature might help.

It was the third-highest sale price ever for a work from a living artist.\n\u201cWhen you think of high-valued NFTs, this one is going to be pretty hard to beat,\u201d MetaKovan said in a statement published by Christie\u2019s. \u201cAnd here\u2019s why \u2014 it represents 13 years of everyday work. Techniques are replicable and skill is surpassable, but the only thing you can\u2019t hack digitally is time. This is the crown jewel, the most valuable piece of art for this generation. It is worth $1 billion.\u201d\n\n\nWhat\u2019s an NFT?\nNFTs allow you to buy and sell ownership of unique digital items and keep track of who owns them using the blockchain. NFT stands for \u201cnon-fungible token,\u201d and it can technically contain anything digital, including drawings, animated GIFs, songs, or items in video games. An NFT can either be one-of-a-kind, like a real-life painting, or one copy of many, like trading cards, but the blockchain keeps track of who has ownership of the file.\nNFTs have been making headlines lately, some selling for millions of dollars, with high-profile memes like Nyan Cat and the \u201cdeal with it\u201d sunglasses being put up for auction. There\u2019s also a lot of discussion about the massive electricity use and\u00a0environmental impacts\u00a0of NFTs.\u00a0If you (understandably) still have questions, you can read through our NFT FAQ.\n\n\nThe $69 million NFT represented a collage containing 5,000 mostly digital illustrations from Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, that were created for his Everydays series, in which he creates a new artwork every day. Winkelmann\u2019s popularity online and his prolific output surely contributed to the sky-high price, but a key driver was also the growing hype around NFTs.\nMetaKovan previously spent more than $2.2 million to acquire 20 single-edition Beeple works in December. Though the works were purchased under an assortment of names, there was apparently just this single entity behind the acquisitions. The organization, MetaPurse, describes itself as a \u201ccrypto-exclusive\u201d fund. Its first project involved building those 20 original Beeple works into a digital museum, then effectively selling shares of that museum as digital tokens so that a multitude of buyers can have a stake in these works.\nNFTs are digital files that live on a blockchain and validate ownership of a related good \u2014 in this case, the collage. Some artists and collectors see them as the future of digital art by finally offering a way for buyers to acquire works that lack a physical component. Prices of NFTs from major artists have exploded in recent weeks, with Grimes selling $6 million worth of NFTs and Steve Aoki selling a single video for $888,888.88.\nWinkelmann told The Verge on Monday that he expects to work with the buyer to find ways to physically display the collage. \u201cDo you want it on a TV in your house? We can do that ... want to do it at Art Basel? Let\u2019s project it on the side of a fucking building,\u201d Winkelmann said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be one way. It can be a bunch of different ways over time.\u201d","Author":"Jacob Kastrenakes"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  1:06pm EST","Title":"Microsoft and newspapers join forces to fight Google","Article":"Over the last decade, hundreds of newspapers have disappeared largely due to Big Tech\u2019s disruption of the ad market. Republicans and Democrats can\u2019t agree on much when it comes to tech reform, whether it be content moderation or spinning off acquisitions, but they do seem to agree that local journalism needs saving.    \nOn Friday, a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing focused on the way Google and Facebook distribute news, and a new bill introduced earlier this week has already found Republican support. It\u2019s one of the biggest legislative threats to tech that\u2019s come out of the years-long antitrust debate, and much of its political force comes from the precarious state of local journalism. \n\u201cThe crisis in American journalism has become a real crisis in our democracy and civic life,\u201d Cicilline said in his opening remarks Friday. \nCiciline\u2019s bill, the \u201cJournalism Competition and Preservation Act of 2021,\u201d would allow news organizations to collectively negotiate with platforms like Facebook and Google the terms in which their content is distributed online. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN), who leads the Senate\u2019s antitrust panel, also sponsored the legislation in the Senate and  Republicans, like Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) and Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO), have already signed on in support of the bill as well. \n\u201cThis bill is a step in the right direction to dethroning those digital kings,\u201d Buck said in his opening remarks Friday. \u201cIt is not a subsidy for outlets, but rather a leveling of the playing field in favor of democracy and free expression.\u201d\nBut while there was growing bipartisan support for the measure on Capitol Hill Friday, the real drama happened beyond the dais. \nWHAT IT MEANS\nThere\u2019s more pressure now than ever for Congress to act. In January, Google threatened to remove its search engine from Australia, responding to a new law that would force the tech giant to pay news publishers for their content. That law was approved in February, and Google quickly backed off to cut a deal with News Corp. and other publishers. \nWhile this all was happening, Microsoft put out a statement in support of Australia\u2019s efforts to protect publishers. \u201cOne thing is clear: while other tech companies may sometimes threaten to leave Australia, Microsoft will never make such a threat,\u201d Microsoft President Brad Smith said in the statement last month. \nSmith was brought in as a witness for Friday\u2019s hearing, announcing his support for Cicilline\u2019s media negotiation bill. Moments before the hearing was set to begin, Google put out its own scathing statement against Microsoft, suggesting that the company was \u201cmaking self-serving claims\u201d that could \u201cbreak the way the open web works in an effort to undercut a rival.\u201d\nGoogle has good reason to be afraid of this bill, especially in light of its Australia bluff. The Cicilline bill has bipartisan support, and its only the subcommittee\u2019s first swing at Big Tech before they wrestle with more sweeping reforms. \nTHE HIGHLIGHT\nGlenn Greenwald, former Intercept editor turned Substack newsletter writer, also testified at Friday\u2019s hearing. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) focused his line of questioning at Greenwald, asking if he feared a bill like the one proposed would only cement the power of larger media firms while leaving local journalism in the dust.\n\u201cThe concern I have is that the discussion in the legislation seems grounded in a premise that the only or the primary problem, to both local and national journalism, is that Google and Facebook are vacuuming up advertising revenue and that you simply fix that problem the problem of media failure will be rectified as well,\u201d Greenwald said. \u201cI think that until the problem that this subcommittee identified in its report is addressed head on, which is breaking up the monopoly powers of this industry, none of these problems will really be fixed.\u201d\nCicilline went back at Greenwald, saying that his bill is just a first step. \u201cThe bill that, at least Mr. Buck and I have put forth\u2026 provides a temporary fix for a 48-month period. And in fact, anything these larger media companies would negotiate would be available to the smallest role newspaper in any city in town in America.\u201d \nHe continued, \u201cWe\u2019re not going to do either or. We\u2019re going to do both.\u201d\nWHAT DIDN\u2019T THEY ASK?\nAs Politico\u2019s Cristiano Lima noted on Twitter, the committee hardly asked any questions about Facebook! Facebook had its own beef with Australia last month, removing the ability for some users and publishers to share news content in the country. In February, the Australian government agreed to several changes that would allow users to continue to publish news, so a thorough conversation on those concessions and how they could affect American users would have been beneficial.\n\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith's written testimony before House Judiciary today mentions Google 7\u20e35\u20e3 times \u203c\ufe0f By contrast, it mentions Facebook 3\u20e3 times\u2014 Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) March 12, 2021\n\n\n\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT? \nThe House Judiciary Committee\u2019s subcommittee on antitrust still has another hearing before it starts introducing legislation. Those bills are expected to land this spring. Klobuchar also told CNN this week that the Senate\u2019s competition committee will also start holding its own hearings on tech\u2019s dominance, looking into app store fees and news publishing. Those hearings have yet to be scheduled.","Author":"Makena Kelly"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  2:32pm EST","Title":"Microsoft\u2019s Edge browser will match Chrome\u2019s upcoming four-week release cycle","Article":"Microsoft is going to adjust its release cycles for Microsoft Edge to match the every-four-weeks release cadence for Chrome that Google announced last week. \n\u201cAs contributors to the Chromium project, we look forward to the new 4-week major release cycle cadence that Google announced to help deliver that innovation to our customers even faster,\u201d Microsoft said in a blog post on Friday.\nThe change will go into effect with Edge 94, which is targeted for a September release.

(You do use a password manager, don\u2019t you?) Managers such as Bitwarden and 1Password have specific methods by which you can share passwords or groups of passwords, making it easier for a family to, say, access a shared streaming service.\nNow Bitwarden has upped the ante by adding a feature it calls Send, which allows you to send files or text (including, if you wish, passwords) securely via end-to-end AES-256 bit encryption, using a link on its site. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBitwarden Send generates a link and includes a number of security options\n\n\nHere\u2019s how it works: If you wish to send a file (it can be up to 100 MB), you go to Bitwarden\u2019s website and click on the Send button. After you upload the file, or create a text message, Send will generate a link that you can send out via email, text, or any other method you choose. When the person you send it to clicks on the link (and they don\u2019t have to be a registered Bitwarden user), they are sent to a page where they can either view the text message or download the file.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut before you send out the link, there are a number of security features you can add. You can set a date and time for the file to automatically be deleted from the linked page (in other words, if you click on the link after that, you\u2019ll be informed it\u2019s no longer available) or for the link to expire. You can limit the number of times the file can be accessed and you can see how many times it\u2019s been accessed so far. And finally, you can set a password for the link.\nIf you\u2019re using Send to create a text message, you can also have it be hidden by default when it is accessed (so the text is not immediately readable). \n\n\n    Related\n  \nThe best free password manager\n\nThe new Send feature will be only partially available to Bitwarden\u2019s free users. Members with free accounts will be able to use it to send text, but not files, while those with Premium and other paid memberships will be able to send both text and files. \nBitwarden is obviously taking full advantage of the recent reported exodus from LastPass because of the latter\u2019s new limitations on its free accounts. Since there are already a number of free services for sending encrypted files, such as WeTransfer, and since having a secure way to send information such as passwords, personal information, and account numbers can be very handy, it looks like Bitwarden has given people another good reason to switch from LastPass. The new Send feature should be available Monday, March 15th at 7 AM.","Author":"Barbara Krasnoff"},{"Date":"Mar 12, 2021,  3:46pm EST","Title":"Amazon Prime Video will soon let you shuffle all the shows you\u2019ve been meaning to binge","Article":"Amazon is updating its Prime Video app to include a new feature: the ability to play episodes of a show on shuffle (via Android Central).

Sure, everyone can appreciate a big, beautiful door with great animations, says Owlchemy Labs developer Pete Galbraith. But in a video game, doors are often synonymous with a massive design headache. Forgettable means a developer has done their job well. \u201cIf it fits into the environment, makes sense for its context, and works exactly how the player expects, then in that instant it was simply a door as real as any other in the player\u2019s real life,\u201d says Galbraith. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine higher praise for a door in a game.\u201d\nOver the past week, dozens of developers across multiple disciplines and teams shared their frustrations on Twitter. Death Trash creator Stephan H\u00f6velbrinks explained that doors \u201chave all sorts of possible bugs.\u201d The Last of Us Part II co-game director Kurt Margenau called it \u201cthe thing that took the longest to get right.\u201d How doors work is different during \u201ccombat tension,\u201d when players are mid-encounter, vs. not, for example: doors slowly close automatically during combat, but remain open during exploration. \u201cIf a player is going to open a door, it can\u2019t just magically fly open, the character has to reach to the doorknob and push it open,\u201d Margenau explained in one tweet. \u201cBut what about closing it behind you? How do you do that while sprinting?\u201d\nIf a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? \nDoors aren\u2019t the only ordinary object developers struggle with. Developers The Verge spoke to point to objects like ropes or mirror. After Half-Life: Alyx\u2019s release, one developer on the project spoke at length about how they managed to make the bottles of booze look so realistic. Designer Liz England points to ladders, elevators, and moving platforms as well. \u201cI think doors themselves tend to get a much bigger reputation for being terrible because they are (1) so much more common in the real world (I use doors every single day!), and (2) are much more common, then, in games, so more people can use it as a touchstone for \u2018unexpectedly difficult interactivity,\u2019\u201d England tells The Verge. \u201cI\u2019ve never had to implement a mirror or a rope, but I have had my fair share of doors.\u201d\nA door isn\u2019t exactly mankind\u2019s best or even smartest invention in the real world. It\u2019s a comically simple concept \u2014 open big rectangle for entry or exit \u2014 that in development becomes a team-wide problem. As Crystal Dynamics game director Will Kerslake put it in a message to The Verge, there are \u201cso many issues with doors.\u201d In one example, touching specifically on animation, Kerslake explained that doors can open toward or away from you; handles can be on either side. \u201cIf you can engage with that door from different states, like crouch or sprinting, then that\u2019s an additional set of animations,\u201d he says. \u201cA door you pull open, requires you to back up in the real world to step out of the way, that\u2019s another set of issues. In a first-person game you can animate the door and not the player, and this is easier. In a high-fidelity third-person game there is an expectation that the player\u2019s hand will move to the handle.\u201d And the players\u2019 location and angle when they engage with any door can and will vary.  \nOther problems might involve several players all scrabbling for a door at the same time, or even non-player characters. If a door hits an NPC, does the door stop, or does the NPC move? \u201cThe choices here can cause all kinds of bugs depending on your game,\u201d says Kerslake.\nIt\u2019s not that making doors in a video game is an impossible task. For some developers, it\u2019s just not worth the trouble. \u201cAs a result many games avoid doors in gameplay, you\u2019d be surprised at how many games don\u2019t have interactive doors at all,\u201d says Keslake. \u201cLots of doorways, but the important doors are missing or already open. The next step up in complexity is doors used only as progress gates, they open only and then can\u2019t be closed again.\u201d \n\u201cyou\u2019d be surprised at how many games don\u2019t have interactive doors at all\u201d\nTechnical points, of which there are many, set aside, how players process the digital representation of a door matters. Everyone knows how a door works and therefore has a subconscious understanding and expectation of how they move, sound, look. The level of accuracy needed for a player to believe the door is a door is higher for a common object than a fantasy one, says Galbraith. \n\u201cOur ideas of how we interact with them are incredibly clear due to the cognitive reinforcement we have received from interacting with them so often in a variety of different ways. For doors like the ones in our homes, we subconsciously learn the minute details of how they act, such as the rate at which they close or how much we can move them while they are locked. So when we see a door in a game that closes too fast or without friction or when there\u2019s a locked door where the handle doesn\u2019t jiggle and make a sound we\u2019ll notice that something isn\u2019t quite right about it.\u201d\nYou can still fib it a little. While most doors only go in one direction, for example, game doors will often swing either way. \u201cWhen these sorts of virtual doors look, sound, and behave like regular doors, then they hit a level of mental acceptance with the player that allows the player to continue without questioning why every door in the game just so happens to open away from them,\u201d Galbraith says. \u201cTo them it\u2019s just a weird coincidence that the brain subconsciously chooses to ignore.\u201d\nDoors aren\u2019t just an aesthetic or immersion technique in video games; often they serve as part of level design. They\u2019re gates that keep players from moving on until they\u2019ve finished a puzzle or beaten a boss; they can act as markers for the player\u2019s progress, build tension, or act as cover. \u201cDoors are just one of a variety of tools that a developer can use when designing levels,\u201d Galbraith says. \u201cMany games employ other methods alongside doors to avoid potential issues and even just to help vary the content.\u201d\nWith one exception: \u201cUnless the door was really tiny and cute, in which case then it\u2019s just a-door-able!\u201d","Author":"Megan Farokhmanesh"}]
